Week 64 - In Progress - Software Crafts Menu Home About Articles 100 words In Progress Week 64 February 9, 2026 · 8 min 12 sec # podcast # weekly-standup Your browser does not support the audio element. ← All episodes RSS Feed Week in Review hello and welcome to week 64 of in progress I always have to check last week was a good week I took most of Monday off played some games went climbing for the first time in a month which was sore but good did there was new climbs so interested enjoyed that it's also nice because it's very quiet on a Monday lunchtime, so you just get the run of the place. What else did I do? And then Tuesday I had the Django chat recording and had which is great and Carlton kind of giving me a little encouragement, quiet a fun. I came to the words not coming to me but a bit of encouragement to maybe submit a CFP for Django con and that which I ended up doing by the end of the week on Friday, kind of got something together so I've got a talk; we'll see if I get picked first. I also did some financial planning which was good because I was a bit nervous about that but, and I should have some invoices being paid today which will help with that a lot. And then I took the end of the week well during the week my wife is ill, and so some plans got through to the wind so I ended up going to my son's class assembly; she was due to go and then took my other son swimming and then was doing bits and pieces and just taking the week quite slowly essentially. I've got everything done but or crossed everything off at least postponed some things to this week. Upcoming Week Speaking of that, that's not this week, no swimming lesson this week which is good. Whatever I do this week there's more reviewing of tickets and getting on with the tickets that I didn't quite finish so there's testing to do more infrastructure stuff and more code stuff; there's just more bits to do while we're waiting for compliance to kick in. Personal Reflections And then there's we need to review the mock-up and that kind of thing for like missing futures because I know there are buttons I've ignored anyway. What else? Got my meeting with myself, I didn't, I was supposed to have last week but postponed to this week. We've got a murder mystery to go to on Friday with some friends which will be fun or at a friend's house and then I might try and have another day off or might do my meeting with myself and have a day off more for just trying to like really intentionally relaxed after intent like the intensity of January. I'm just feeling it mentally that it was really interesting to be so focused on it, and kind of feel slightly guilty about the weekend and stuff where I'm like I'm not I should be doing something slightly or like should be doing work but not. And I enjoyed the intensity; it's like if I didn't have a family I was single or even not single I like if I was in a different scenario I would be working on this, like day and night, and making a lot more progress but that's not the case because that life is not all about work. Future Blog Posts But yeah, that's that's this week. Was it? I'm also going to try and get another hundred words in got one in last week about model renderers which we talked about a little bit on Django chat so that would be interesting when that comes out this week. I've got one in my head, I've had one in my head about kind of talking about infrastructure which might be a couple of posts because there's a few things in there but just getting down some thoughts about about infrastructure and kind of like deployment and CI/CD that kind of thing anyway. Administrative Tasks Otherwise, there's a load of admin as well that I've got listed down here like I've still got some tax to sort out; I've got we're buying some land I need to kind of follow up on that there's other hub admin to do it just all piles up slowly but surely so you just got like knock them down really quickly anyway. That is that's my week trying to think if there's anything interesting else to say in terms of the tickets I'm working on but not really it's more yeah it's trying to get the infrastructure stuff done would be nice. Infrastructure and Automation The other side with the infrastructure with actually with the start-up with Hamilton Rock is now that I'm switching from like Greenfield to Brownfield, it's like it's in a deployed state; it's Brownfield kind of but the idea that there's I'm really want to explore the idea of agents so like two kind of things that are in my head or two processes in my head one is like having an agent maybe that just continually tests the core workflows I've listed them out of like moving money, different ways of moving money opening accounts that kind of thing and just be like I wonder if they if you have an agent or made multiple agents running over those or maybe this is just playwright and I need to just delve into playwright; I don't know but the idea of just knowing when those break and automating that in some way maybe it's getting AI to help me write some playwright tests, that's just come to me. The other one is and I think I've talked about this before but it I'm really I have Django Waffle installed for feature flags; I think I need to go back and really delve into that because I want to add kind of approvals to that because we're gonna have we have I want our normal I would like a normal dev cycle of us pushing, see us me pushing multiple times a day when a feature is done it gets merged into main if test pass it merges into gets deployed to staging and production; it's just there but always behind a feature flag but then I would like some extra checks on the feature flag to go it's been signed off with compliance therefore can go live that kind of extra step so I might need to reset everything again because I think it's a swappable model so it needs to kind of reset which is gonna be fun anyway. Meta Tools and Agents I need to look into that and I'm thinking maybe I'm kind of thinking about as well what meta tools do I do, do I develop so do I develop a custom subagents do I deliver there's Claude skills there's other things like other agent or do I develop custom agents running in the background to check and do small specific tasks that are checking for things; I don't know anyway that's enough for today. I'm hit at eight minutes have a good week being in progress, and I will speak to you all next week for week 65. Cheers folks, bye-bye! Comments Loading comments...

Book Report: Accelerate: the science behind DevOps · Better Simple Mentoring Learn Blog About Contact Let's Meet! Mentoring Learn Blog About Contact Let's Meet! Book Report: Accelerate: the science behind DevOps February 09, 2026 This is a review of the book “Accelerate: the science behind DevOps: building and scaling high performing technology organizations” by Nicole Forsgren, PhD, Jez Humble and Gene Kim. Read this book if: You are interested in improving the culture of your team or organization Are interested in software development processes Want to reduce burnout in your organization Want to discover how create and/or be part of a high performing team Are interested in scientific measurements of software development Roland, an orange cat, is laying on the book "Accelerate" by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim. As a book that describes itself as “the science behind DevOps”, it definitely meets that mark. I found this book very insightful and well reasoned. I believe they have hit the mark on how to unlock high-performing organizations. Maybe because it aligns with my “ship faster” desire. Published in 2018, it’s done fairly well at remaining relevant with today’s industry. The main premise is that software delivery performance is critical to an organization and that performance is affected by leadership, tools, automation and a culture of continuous learning and improvement 1 . The authors break this down by explaining that they’ve measured organizations performance and statistically proved that software delivery performance drives organizational performance. They have identified 24 capabilities that can be defined, measure and improved on 2 . These capabilities are broken up into five categories: Continuous delivery Architecture Product and process Lean management and monitoring Cultural There were several parts to this book that stood out to me. I had continuous delivery wrong I thought I knew what continuous delivery meant. Automated deployments right? Nope. I mean, it is, but it’s about other things, including shipping faster. The biggest piece I learned is the idea is that your branch should only last a day and at that point it should be merged back into the trunk 3 . It’s about limiting the Work In Progress (WIP) branches and highlighting them. Knowing you need to ship production ready code in one day requires the team’s culture and process to change. In fact, it causes the software to change. Everything needs to become more adaptable and flexible. Which sets up the software to implement the feedback from users more efficiently. Throughout the book the authors discuss how culture changes can happen by changing how people work 4 . I love that this example was given so early in the book which helped me understand exactly how that can be true. The power of surveys I’ve done some statistics in my life. Not enough to be competent by any means, but enough to know I should know more. “Accelerate” does an excellent job of explaining their process of data collection in Part 3: The Research 5 . The authors go into detail about why surveys can be trusted because by using “carefully identified measures, latent constructs, and statistical methods to confirm the validity and reliability of measures” 6 . It all seems to make sense, but I promise you, I will have to reread these chapters when I go to work on my next survey. Should you read this book? I think there’s a lot of value in this book. That said, it’s something that’s more valuable when you’re open to learning, which means being open to being wrong. “Accelerate” does a good job of showing you the way to improvement and ends on the most telling piece of life philosophy, develop the right mindset, practice discipline, practice patience and practice practice 7 .

Time to dive into the biggest Python news from the past month! Join Now: Click here to join the Real Python Newsletter and you’ll never miss another Python tutorial, course, or news update. Python Releases and PEP Highlights Last month brought two Python 3.15 alpha releases in quick succession, with notable JIT compiler improvements showing promising performance gains. Several PEPs also emerged, including one proposing a cleaner way to write multiline strings. Remove ads Python 3.15.0 Alpha 4 and 5: Two Releases in Two Days January saw an unusual situation in Python’s release history: Python 3.15.0a4 arrived on January 13, but it was accidentally compiled against outdated source code from December 2025. The release team quickly followed up with 3.15.0a5 on January 14 to correct the issue. Both releases continue the work on Python 3.15’s headline features: UTF-8 as the default text encoding for files that don’t specify an encoding, via PEP 686 A new statistical sampling profiler that’s high-frequency and low-overhead, via PEP 799 The PyBytesWriter C API for creating bytes objects more efficiently, via PEP 782 Enhanced error messages with improved clarity and usefulness The most exciting news for performance enthusiasts is the continued progress on Python’s experimental JIT compiler. Alpha 5 reports a 4–5% performance improvement on x86-64 Linux and a 7–8% speedup on AArch64 macOS compared to the standard interpreter . Note: These are preview releases and are not recommended for production. The beta phase begins May 5, 2026, with the next alpha, 3.15.0a6, scheduled for February 10, 2026. If you maintain packages, now is a good time to start running tests against the alphas in a separate environment so you can catch regressions early. PEP 822 Drafted: Dedented Multiline Strings (d-strings) A new PEP emerged in January that could make writing multiline strings clearer. PEP 822 , authored by Inada Naoki, proposes adding dedented multiline strings (d-strings) to Python. If you’ve ever written a multiline string inside an indented function or class, you’ve likely run into the awkward choice between breaking your code’s visual structure or using textwrap.dedent() to clean up the extra whitespace. PEP 822 offers a cleaner solution with a new d prefix: Python def get_help_message (): # Current approach return textwrap . dedent ( """ \ Usage: app [options] Options: -h Show this help message -v Enable verbose mode """ ) # Proposed d-string approach return d """ Usage: app [options] Options: -h Show this help message -v Enable verbose mode """ The d prefix tells Python to automatically strip the common leading whitespace from each line, using the indentation of the closing quotes as a reference. This differs slightly from textwrap.dedent() , which uses the least-indented line to determine how much to strip. The proposal targets Python 3.15 and is currently in draft status. If you work with templates, SQL queries, or any code that embeds multiline text, this feature could simplify your workflow. You can follow the discussion on the Python Discourse and provide feedback while the PEP is still being refined. PSF News: Investments, Fellows, and Survey The Python Software Foundation (PSF) had a busy month with a major security investment announcement, new Fellows recognition, and the launch of the annual developers survey. Anthropic Invests in Python Security In a significant boost for Python’s security infrastructure, Anthropic announced a $1.5 million investment over two years to enhance security across the Python ecosystem. The funding focuses particularly on protecting PyPI users from supply-chain attacks . The investment will support several key initiatives: Creating automated tools for proactive review of all PyPI packages, moving beyond the current reactive-only process Developing a malware dataset to enable novel detection tools Building transferable solutions applicable to other open-source package repositories The funding also sustains core PSF operations, including the Developer in Residence Program for CPython contributions, community grants, and infrastructure maintenance. If you maintain packages , this investment means better tooling and protection for the ecosystem you depend on. Remove ads PSF Announces Q4 2025 Fellows The PSF announced its fourth batch of Fellow Members for 2025 , recognizing seven new honorees: Chris Brousseau , Dave Forgac , Inessa Pawson , James Abel , Karen Dalton , Mia Bajić, and Tatiana Andrea Delgadillo Garzofino . These members were recognized for exceptional contributions to the Python ecosystem. Their work includes maintaining libraries, creating educational materials, organizing conferences, and mentoring newcomers. If you know someone who deserves recognition, the PSF is accepting nominations for Q1 2026 at psf-fellow@python.org. Python Developers Survey 2026 Is Open The PSF and JetBrains have launched the ninth annual Python Developers Survey , aiming to capture the current state of Python and its ecosystem. The survey takes about 10–15 minutes to complete and is available in eight languages. You can participate at Python Developers Survey 2026 . Upon completion, you’ll be entered into a drawing where 20 randomly selected participants will each receive a $100 Amazon gift card. Library and Tooling Updates January saw major releases across the Python ecosystem, from data science powerhouses to developer tools. Here are the most relevant releases. pandas 3.0: A Major Release With Breaking Changes Taking center stage, pandas 3.0.0 was released on January 21. This first major release in years brings significant improvements, cleaner semantics, and performance enhancements, along with breaking changes that will affect most pandas users. Note: The pandas team strongly recommends upgrading to pandas 2.3 first and ensuring your code runs without warnings before migrating to 3.0. The headline changes include: Dedicated string dtype by default : Strings now infer to str dtype instead of object , providing better type safety and performance. Copy-on-Write (CoW) semantics : All indexing operations now behave as copies, eliminating unpredictable copy/view behavior. This change breaks chained assignment like df[col][row] = value . New pd.col() expression syntax : Provides a cleaner way to create callable expressions for methods like .assign() . Arrow PyCapsule interface : DataFrame .from_arrow() and Series.from_arrow() now provide zero-copy data transfer between libraries. Anti-joins support : The pd.merge() method supports the how="left_anti" option. Here are the breaking changes to watch for: Datetime resolution defaults have changed from nanoseconds to microseconds The pytz package is now optional, with zoneinfo from the standard library used by default Offset aliases have changed: M → ME , Q → QE , Y → YE The minimum Python version is now 3.11+ If you’re using any of these features and want to migrate to 3.0, then make sure you address them consistently. Django Bugfix Releases The Django team shipped bugfix releases on January 6, with Django 5.2.10 and Django 6.0.1 now available. Note: If you’re not yet in the Python web development world but are curious about Django, you can give it a try and start building your portfolio with it . If you’ve recently upgraded to Django 6.0 or are running 5.2.x in production, it’s worth grabbing these patches. Check the release notes for 5.2.10 and 6.0.1 for the full list of fixes. Remove ads Polars 1.37: Performance and Python 3.10+ Required Polars 1.37.0 arrived with performance improvements and an important change: Python 3.9 support has been dropped . If you’re still on Python 3.9, you’ll need to upgrade before updating Polars. Note: To get started with Polars, check out the Python Polars: A Lightning-Fast DataFrame Library tutorial. Key improvements include the following: Faster SQL interface ORDER BY clauses New streaming NDJSON and CSV sink implementations A new pl.PartitionBy API for improved partition handling Support for Python’s free-threading mode The release also adds Series.sql() for API consistency and new methods like pl.Expr.min_by() and pl.Expr.max_by() . PyTorch 2.10: Performance and TorchScript Deprecation PyTorch 2.10 landed with over 4,160 commits from 536 contributors. The release brings significant performance improvements and an important deprecation. Here are some performance highlights: Combo-kernels horizontal fusion : Combines multiple independent operations into a single GPU kernel, reducing launch overhead Variable length attention ( varlen_attn() ) : Provides support for ragged and packed sequences Intel GPU optimizations : Support for Intel Core Ultra Series 3, FP8 support, and expanded Windows support The big news for many users is that TorchScript is now deprecated . The PyTorch team recommends migrating to torch.export for model deployment. Other notable news includes Python 3.14 support and a new release cadence of one release every two months in 2026. Black 26.1.0: The 2026 Stable Style Black 26.1.0 has introduced the 2026 stable style, stabilizing several formatting improvements that were previously in preview mode: Always forces one blank line after import statements Improved module docstring detection More compact multiline string expressions Removes unnecessary parentheses around multiple exception types in except clauses Formats type comments with proper spacing These improvements make the Black formatter more consistent and capable. AI and Python Highlights In an interesting intersection of AI and open-source, Linux creator Linus Torvalds shared that he used Google Antigravity to build a Python visualization tool for audio samples—despite admitting he knows little about the language. He described the experience as “vibe coding” , bypassing the traditional workflow of searching for documentation and copying code snippets in favor of direct AI code generation. It’s a notable mention of AI coding tools from one of the most influential figures in software development, showing how AI can help developers accomplish tasks in languages they’re less familiar with. On the tooling front, GitHub announced the Copilot SDK in technical preview on January 22. The SDK lets developers embed agentic AI capabilities directly into their applications, with support for Python, Node.js, Go, and .NET. It provides programmatic access to the same execution loop powering GitHub Copilot CLI, including multi-step workflow planning, custom tool invocation, file editing, and integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers .

Title: Python: introducing icu4py, bindings to the Unicode ICU library

Python: introducing icu4py, bindings to the Unicode ICU library - Adam Johnson Adam Johnson Home | Blog | Books | Projects | Consulting | Contact | Colophon Python: introducing icu4py, bindings to the Unicode ICU library 2026-02-09 I made a new package! Thank you to my client Rippling for inspiring and sponsoring its development. ICU (International Components for Unicode) is Unicodeâs official library for Unicode and Globalization tools. Itâs a de-facto standard for handling text in a locale-aware way, used by many major projects , including Chrome, Firefox, macOS, VS Code, and so on. ICU comes in two flavours: ICU4C (for C/C++) and ICU4J (for Java). (Thereâs also the newer ICU4X , built in Rust, but itâs a bit more of a work-in-progress.) My new package, icu4py , exposes some ICU4C functionality in Python, translating the C++ API into a more Pythonic one. It currently supports boundary analysis (breaking text into words, sentences, etc.) and message formatting (using the ICU MessageFormat syntax). Iâm open to adding more ICU features in the future, depending on demand. Batteries included Hereâs a summary of the two features included in icu4py right now. Boundary analysis For example, ICU supports text boundary analysis : finding linguistic boundaries in text, such as words or sentences, based on per-language rules. These are useful for things like accurate word counts, or wrapping text for display. icu4py exposes this feature through âbreakerâ classes. For example, to split text into sentences using SentenceBreaker : >>> from icu4py.breakers import SentenceBreaker >>> text = 'You asked "Why?". We answered "Why not?"' >>> breaker = SentenceBreaker ( text , "en_GB" ) >>> list ( breaker ) ['You asked "Why?". ', 'We answered "Why not?"'] Note the quoted sentences are kept within their outer ones. Brilliant translation with MessageFormat ICU also provides a flexible translation tool called MessageFormat . This allows translators to write patterns that capture the nuances of different languages, like varying pluralization rules. icu4py exposes this API through its MessageFormat class: >>> from icu4py.messageformat import MessageFormat >>> pattern = "{count,plural,one {# file} other {# files}}" >>> fmt = MessageFormat ( pattern , "en_GB" ) >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 0 }) '0 files' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 1 }) '1 file' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 5 }) '5 files' In this case, our pluralization varies the output based on whether the count variable is one or any other number. French has a subtle but important differenceâit treats zero as singular, unlike English: >>> pattern = "{count,plural,one {# fichier} other {# fichiers}}" >>> fmt = MessageFormat ( pattern , "fr_FR" ) >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 0 }) '0 fichier' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 1 }) '1 fichier' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 2 }) '2 fichiers' This example shows an important point: the meaning of the one category is defined by the locale. In French, the âoneâ category matches both 0 and 1 because they both use the singular form. Korean has no plural distinction at allâthe same form is used regardless of count: >>> pattern = "{count,plural,other {# íì¼}}" >>> fmt = MessageFormat ( pattern , "ko_KR" ) >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 0 }) '0 íì¼' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 1 }) '1 íì¼' >>> fmt . format ({ "count" : 5 }) '5 íì¼' ICU handles all these variations automatically based on the locale, so you don't need to know the rules for each language. MessageFormat version 2 is in the works, complete with its own site . Itâs in technical preview in ICU4C, and I aim to expose it in icu4py soon, tracked in Issue #17 . Backstory Rippling is a global HR, Payroll, IT, and Finance platform, with over 20,000 customers all over the world. They work hard to make their product available in many languages and locales. Their Data Globalization team found that ICU Messageformat would present a great next step to handle complex localized messages in their product. Since they use Python (and Django), they needed to pick a Python library to integrate ICU. This is where the challenge started. In a Slack thread, we surveyed the existing options, and found them all lacking, especially on two points: None provided compiled wheels, a strong necessity for smooth installation among Ripplingâs 1,000+ engineers. They all depend on a system-based install of ICU, which could present different versions between environments. In particular, we found these options: pyicu - impressively maintained since 2007, but poorly documented, has a clunky C++-style API, and lacks some key Python modernization. For example, its C++ extensions donât use multi-phase initialization, per PEP 489 , which is required to support sub-interpreters, as Rippling may wish to adopt in the future. Additionally, while working on this project, its self-hosted Gitlab went down, and it hasnât been restored for some weeks. This does not bode well for long-term maintenance! icupy - newer, modern, and better-maintained, but it still copies the C++ API directly, which is quite unwieldy. pyseeyou - a pure-Python implementation of MessageFormat. While this library is appealing in terms of ease of installation, it performs all parsing and formatting in Python, making it fairly slow. Additionally, the package does not provide any locale-specific formatting. After this survey, I opted to try my hand at creating a proof-of-concept package for calling the ICU4Câs C++ class MessageFormat from Python. Now, C++ is a beautifully haunted language, and Iâm correspondingly uncomfortable with it. While I have developed some Python C extensions before, like time-machine , until this point I had not touched C++ since my university days. Thankfully, we are living in the LLM era and this kind of âglue two things togetherâ task is something that they excel at. Within a few hours, my mate Claude and I had a working prototype that could handle basic formatting: from icupoc import MessageFormat # English plurals pattern = "{count, plural, one {# file} other {# files}}" fmt = MessageFormat ( pattern , "en_US" ) print ( fmt . format ({ "count" : 1 })) # "1 file" print ( fmt . format ({ "count" : 5 })) # "5 files" (You can still see this prototype at icupoc .) Happy with the PoC, Rippling gave me the go-ahead to build out a full ICU package. Building I continued to use Claude when building out icu4py proper, and I guess I was âagentic engineeringâ (or âvibe engineeringâ ). While I used the LLM to generate code, I reviewed every line, making many edits before any step was ready. I also deployed my usual stack of tools to format code, check types, build robust documentation, etc. Using an LLM essentially made this project feasible. A few years ago, I would have shied away from writing in C++ and it would probably have taken me a lot longer to get running. But instead of finding C++ big/scary, having many of the small details taken care of made the project fun! Things werenât all smooth sailing, though. Rippling have several âblessedâ languages, including Rust, for which they have a monorepo with lots of tooling set up. Before deciding to build the open source package, I tried to build an internal Rust-based version. I made several different attempts to build Rust-to-C++ bindings, spending a silly amount of tokens and time going down rabbit holes to determine that various approaches donât work or arenât worth it. The LLMâs confidence and sycophany led me to trying ideas for a long time before cutting my losses. If I had known more about C++ or Rust, I think I wouldnât have tried using Rust to begin with! I also learned that LLMs are really poor at using all of their embedded knowledge at once. Even when writing the proof-of-concept, I prompted Claude to improve its own code and it came up with many changes ( commit ). That said, re-applying this trick more times made it adopt advanced C++ abstractions, completely unnecessarily. It seems that to get high quality code, you need to loop an LLM around a few times on the same code while still using your judgement to know when to stop. Documentation was critical for getting good results. I often copied sections or whole pages from Python or ICUâs documentation straight into the LLM chat. For ICUâs auto-generated class documentation, I used Jina Reader to convert its dense HTML to Markdown. Docs are king, and even more so now. That said, using LLM-generated code did free up my time to write and edit the documentation more than I usually would. I made sure to include sensible links to the relevant parts of ICUâs documentation, as well as great examples. icu4c-builds A large part of building icu4py was compiling ICU4C itself. It quickly became clear that I couldnât build icu4py wheels that depended on the system ICU library because binding to C++ classes within a dynamic library is very tricky. Therefore, I built a second repository, icu4c-builds , which builds ICU4C in the exact setup I need for icu4py. Getting icu4c-builds working across Linux, macOS, and Windows and multiple architectures was a challenge with many long-running failed builds. Claude was very useful here, though, since it has a lot of embedded knowledge around small details like compiler flags. At some points, I was just shovelling logs between GitHub Actions and Claude, wondering why I was even there. Anyway, now the build system seems to be in a good place, and since ICU is pretty stable, the process is unlikely to break in the future. Future work Right now, icu4py only has bindings to two ICU modules: boundary analysis and message formatting. There are 40+ more to bind to, providing all kinds of features likely to be useful in globalizing Python apps. If there are modules that youâd like available, please open an issue ! Iâm pretty confident that with a solid foundation to copy from, LLMs can churn through building further bindings pretty quickly. That said, I still think itâs key for icu4pyâs success to design an API that makes sense in Python, for which I think human taste still prevails. On the Django side, I think there could be a place for writing an integration for icu4py with Djangoâs existing internationalization and localization framework . While thereâs a lot of overlap, ICU has a lot of extra features that could be useful. Fin Please check out icu4py for your text boundary analysis and translation needs! Thanks again to Rippling for paying for this work. â­ Working with them is a fun challengeâeven small changes can have a large impact, thanks to their massive scale.

But then reality hits -- containers, load balancers, HTTPS certificates, cloud consoles with 200 options. What if deploying was just one command? That's exactly what Sebastian Ramirez and the FastAPI Cloud team are building. On this episode, I sit down with Sebastian, Patrick Arminio, Savannah Ostrowski, and Jonathan Ehwald to go inside FastAPI Cloud, explore what it means to build a "Pythonic" cloud, and dig into how this commercial venture is actually making FastAPI the open-source project stronger than ever. Play on YouTube Watch the live stream version Overcast Apple Castbox PocketCasts RSS RadioPublic Spotify Pro Edition --> YouTube Canary Every episode in your player of choice Episode Deep Dive Guests This episode features four members of the FastAPI Cloud team: Sebastian Ramirez (Tiangolo) -- Creator of FastAPI, the Python web framework that has become the most-starred backend framework on GitHub across all languages (nearly 95,000 stars). Sebastian is also known for his viral tweet about a job posting requiring five years of FastAPI experience when he had only created the framework 2.5 years prior. He is the founder of FastAPI Labs, the company behind FastAPI Cloud, backed by Sequoia Capital. Patrick Arminio -- Creator of Strawberry, a popular Python library for building GraphQL APIs. Patrick is also an organizer of PyCon Italy and a former EuroPython organizer. At FastAPI Cloud, he leads integrations and CLI tooling work. Savannah Ostrowski -- A CPython core developer, member of the Python Steering Council for 2026, and the release manager for Python 3.16 and 3.17. She works on the CPython JIT, argparse, and other areas of CPython. At FastAPI Cloud, she brings deep Python ecosystem expertise and previously worked on cloud tooling at other companies. Jonathan Ehwald -- A backend and infrastructure engineer at FastAPI Cloud. He joined the team after EuroPython and focuses on Kubernetes controllers, build caching, deployment internals, and performance optimization. He is the author of the open-source fastar library for fast tar archive handling in Python, powered by Rust. What to Know If You're New to Python FastAPI is one of the most popular Python frameworks for building web APIs and backends. It uses Python type hints to provide automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive API documentation. Understanding the basics of how web APIs work (routes, requests, responses) will help you get the most out of this episode. uv is a modern, extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. It replaces tools like pip, virtualenv, and pipx. Several commands in this episode reference uvx (which runs tools without installing them globally), so knowing that uv exists and what it does will be helpful context. Deployment refers to taking code that runs on your local machine and making it available on the internet for others to use. Much of this episode discusses the complexity of cloud deployment and how FastAPI Cloud aims to simplify it to a single command. Key Points and Takeaways 1. FastAPI Cloud: One-Command Deployment for Python Developers FastAPI Cloud is a new deployment platform built by the creators of FastAPI that reduces deploying a FastAPI application to a single command: fastapi deploy . The platform handles HTTPS, auto-scaling, builds, and infrastructure so developers can focus entirely on writing application code. Sebastian described it as "the equivalent of what FastAPI is to building web APIs" -- just as FastAPI simplified API development, FastAPI Cloud aims to simplify deployment. The product is currently in private beta with a waiting list, and the team is actively onboarding users. fastapicloud.com -- FastAPI Cloud website and waiting list fastapi.tiangolo.com -- FastAPI framework documentation 2. A "Pythonic" Cloud Experience The team discussed how they are deliberately trying to make FastAPI Cloud feel "Pythonic" -- not just simple, but specifically aligned with the sensibilities and expectations of Python developers. Jonathan described this as "choosing a particular flavor of simple" that transfers the Pythonic ethos from libraries and coding style to the cloud experience. Savannah emphasized that the platform is "bespoke for Python developers," integrating with modern tooling like uv rather than being a generic cloud platform that also happens to support Python. This focus on Python-native ergonomics is a distinguishing factor from broader cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Vercel. 3. The fastapi new Scaffolding Command Savannah built a CLI command called fastapi new (run via uvx fastapi-new ) that scaffolds a complete FastAPI project from scratch. It creates the folder structure, installs dependencies using uv, and generates a basic FastAPI application ready to deploy. This is especially useful for beginners and educators who want to go from zero to a working, deployable application without worrying about project setup. For developers who already have an existing FastAPI app, the scaffolding step is entirely optional -- they can go straight to fastapi deploy . pypi.org/project/fastapi-cli -- FastAPI CLI on PyPI (includes fastapi-new as an optional dependency) 4. Broad Package Manager Support: uv, pylock.toml, and requirements.txt FastAPI Cloud supports multiple dependency management formats. The primary and recommended experience uses uv with uv.lock files, but the platform also supports pylock.toml (the new PEP 751 standard lock file format championed by Brett Cannon), plain requirements.txt , and any package manager that uses the standard pyproject.toml format (such as PDM or recent versions of Poetry). Sebastian noted that uv users will have "the best experience" since the team are self-described fans, but the goal is to meet developers wherever they are in their tooling choices. github.com/astral-sh/uv -- uv: extremely fast Python package manager written in Rust peps.python.org/pep-0751 -- PEP 751: pylock.toml standard lock file format 5. The "Bus Ticket Factor": A New Way to Think About Open Source Sustainability Sebastian introduced a reframing of the well-known "bus factor" concept. Rather than worrying about how many maintainers a project has, he encouraged listeners to think about the "bus ticket factor" -- who is paying for the bus tickets? In other words, what value are the people maintaining a project receiving in exchange for their work? He pointed out that even large companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta cancel products despite having massive teams, so headcount alone does not determine sustainability. The real question is whether there is a sustainable incentive -- financial, personal, or otherwise -- for maintainers to keep investing in the project. FastAPI Cloud provides that alignment: the more successful FastAPI (and Python) are, the more potential customers FastAPI Cloud has. 6. Commercial Open Source Done Right: How FastAPI Cloud Strengthens FastAPI A significant portion of the conversation addressed how the commercial FastAPI Cloud venture gives back to the open-source FastAPI project. The team actively dogfoods FastAPI, SQLModel, and related libraries internally, which means bugs get found and fixed faster, leading to more frequent releases. Savannah noted that her employer values and supports her open-source CPython contributions, including her Steering Council and release management work. Sebastian emphasized that the incentive alignment is financial, not just principled: FastAPI's success drives FastAPI Cloud's potential, so investing in the open-source project is inherently good for the business. FastAPI has over 7,000 forks, making it essentially un-disappearable as open source. github.com/fastapi/fastapi -- FastAPI on GitHub (94.9k+ stars) sqlmodel.tiangolo.com -- SQLModel: SQL databases in Python with type hints 7. Kubernetes Under the Hood with Auto-Scaling to Zero Jonathan revealed that FastAPI Cloud is built on Kubernetes at its foundation, with standard cloud providers underneath that. On top of Kubernetes, the team has built custom controllers (written in Go) and additional infrastructure to handle the complexity that users never have to see. A standout feature is request-based auto-scaling, including the ability to scale down to zero when no traffic is coming in. This is not the same as AWS Lambda -- the full container with all dependencies runs as a complete application, but the platform dynamically adjusts the number of replicas based on incoming requests, potentially saving users significant costs compared to always-on infrastructure. 8. fastar : An Open-Source Rust-Powered Library Born from Internal Needs Jonathan open-sourced fastar , a Rust-backed Python library for compressing and decompressing tar archives that serves as a near drop-in replacement for Python's standard tarfile module but runs significantly faster. The library was born out of FastAPI Cloud's deployment pipeline, where shaving seconds off archive operations during builds made a meaningful difference. This exemplifies the team's philosophy of building internal tools as separate, well-structured packages and open-sourcing them when they are ready. Sebastian noted that the team has open-sourced (or plans to open-source) several internal tools, including authentication/authorization libraries and CLI tooling. pypi.org/project/fastar -- fastar on PyPI: high-performance tar archive handling backed by Rust 9. Integrations: Supabase, Hugging Face, Logfire, Redis, and More The team discussed their approach to third-party integrations. Current and upcoming integrations include Supabase (Postgres as a service), Hugging Face (AI/ML models), Pydantic Logfire (observability), Redis, and potentially MongoDB. Patrick explained that integrations go beyond simply setting environment variables -- the goal is deep integration where, for example, creating a pull request preview deployment could automatically create a corresponding Supabase database branch. The team is not hosting databases themselves but instead connecting with best-in-class external providers through OAuth and API integrations. supabase.com -- Supabase: the Postgres development platform pydantic.dev/logfire -- Pydantic Logfire: observability platform huggingface.co -- Hugging Face: AI model hub and platform 10. The Impact of AI on Documentation-Driven Businesses Michael raised the cautionary tale of Tailwind CSS, whose npm downloads are up six times year over year while revenue is down five times. The reason: AI tools can generate Tailwind code directly without users visiting the documentation site, where they would discover premium offerings. The group discussed how FastAPI Cloud is in a different position because it provides ongoing operational value (hosting, scaling, security) that AI cannot replace. Jonathan noted that AI could theoretically maintain infrastructure someday, but "it's just too hard at the moment," and what FastAPI Cloud really sells is responsibility -- shifting the risk and operational burden from the developer's team to theirs. 11. Python Performance: The Specializing Adaptive Interpreter and Beyond Savannah and Michael touched on the significant performance improvements in recent Python versions. The specializing adaptive interpreter, introduced around Python 3.11, has been a major factor in making Python faster. Savannah also mentioned her work on the CPython JIT compiler. Michael noted that Python 3.9 through 3.11 did foundational work that "uncorked a lot of innovation" in Python's runtime performance. Savannah also observed that Python is the language used most in AI-generated code, adding a new dimension to Python's continued relevance and growth. 12. The Cult.Repo FastAPI Documentary Michael gave a shout-out to the Cult.Repo (formerly Honeypot) documentary on FastAPI called "The Rise and Rise of FastAPI." The same production team behind the official Python documentary created this approximately 10-minute mini documentary about FastAPI's origin story. Sebastian shared that the Cult.Repo team reached out to him while they were still producing their Python documentary trailer, asking to include FastAPI in their series of framework documentaries. The production quality was praised as excellent. cultrepo.com -- Cult.Repo: open source developer documentaries 13. Custom Domains and the Roadmap Ahead Michael asked about custom domain support, which is actively being developed by Jonathan. Patrick added that for DNS providers that support OAuth, the team aims to enable one-click domain setup, automatically handling DNS records and certificate provisioning. The platform is currently in private beta with thousands of people on the waiting list. Sebastian noted that they manually review waiting list submissions, looking at use cases and team sizes, and that providing detailed information about what you plan to build increases the chances of being admitted sooner. Future plans include supporting more Python frameworks beyond FastAPI and expanding based on user feedback gathered through their GitHub issues repo and community Slack. 14. Education and the Value of Quick Iteration Cycles Both Michael and Savannah highlighted how FastAPI Cloud could be a game-changer for Python education. In coding bootcamps, university classes, and corporate training sessions, setting up deployment infrastructure is a time-consuming distraction from the actual curriculum. Savannah pointed out that "setting up the environment for them to deploy is not part of it -- it's this peripheral thing that ends up eating up a bunch of the educator's time." With fastapi deploy , students can go from a working local app to a live internet deployment in seconds, creating a powerful "aha moment" that motivates further learning. Interesting Quotes and Stories "It's one command. It's fastapi deploy. And you have a FastAPI app, you just hit fastapi deploy, and then it's on the cloud. We take care of everything." -- Sebastian Ramirez "I saw a job post asking for five years of experience with FastAPI and I only had 2.5 since I created the thing." -- Sebastian Ramirez, on his viral meme about tech recruiting "If you make a cloud, how do we make it feel Pythonic? Like what does that mean in a cloud setting? We talk about Pythonic libraries and coding style in the community a lot, and now we kind of try to transfer that flavor, that feeling, to the cloud." -- Jonathan Ehwald "Every time people talk about the bus factor, I would like people to think about the bus ticket factor -- who is paying for those tickets?" -- Sebastian Ramirez "I don't have to fight the open source battle at FastAPI Cloud. I think that's really cool." -- Savannah Ostrowski, on working at a company that values her open-source CPython contributions "Some of us don't even get to write Python anymore to make all of this happen. I'm taking one for the team." -- Jonathan Ehwald, on writing Go for Kubernetes controllers so Python developers can have a simple experience "Building Python tooling is kind of like taking one for the team sometimes, because you have these folks that are brand new to Python. Python is an extremely approachable language for people who are new to writing code. But then we also want to make FastAPI Cloud work for someone that's building an enterprise-grade application." -- Savannah Ostrowski "Stack Overflow had as many questions asked this month as they did in the first month of their existence -- three or four thousand, whereas at their peak, they were 200,000 questions a month." -- Michael Kennedy, on the impact of AI on developer Q&A Key Definitions and Terms Bus Factor -- A measure of risk in a project: how many team members would need to be unavailable (metaphorically "hit by a bus") before the project stalls. A bus factor of one means a single person's departure could halt progress. Bus Ticket Factor -- Sebastian's reframing of the bus factor concept, focusing on the sustainability question: what incentives (financial, personal, or strategic) keep the maintainers investing their time and energy in the project? Dogfooding -- The practice of using your own product internally. FastAPI Cloud is built on FastAPI and SQLModel, so bugs found internally get fixed and released to the open-source community. Scale to Zero -- An auto-scaling feature where the number of running application instances can drop to zero when there is no incoming traffic, reducing costs. The application spins back up when new requests arrive. pylock.toml (PEP 751) -- A new Python standard for lock files, providing a reproducible, human-readable format for recording exact dependency versions. Championed by Brett Cannon and accepted in 2025. Private Beta -- A pre-release phase where a limited number of users are granted access to test the product and provide feedback before a public launch. Platform as a Service (PaaS) -- A cloud computing model where the provider manages the underlying infrastructure (servers, networking, scaling), allowing developers to focus solely on their application code. Learning Resources Here are resources to learn more about the topics discussed in this episode and go deeper with your Python and FastAPI skills.

Rock Solid Python with Python Typing : FastAPI relies heavily on Python type hints for data validation and documentation. This course teaches you the ins and outs of Python typing, including Pydantic and FastAPI-specific patterns. Overall Takeaway FastAPI Cloud represents a compelling new chapter for the FastAPI ecosystem -- one where the simplicity that made FastAPI beloved for building APIs is now being extended to deployment itself. What stands out most from this conversation is the deep alignment between the open-source project and the commercial product: every improvement to FastAPI Cloud feeds back into FastAPI, and every new FastAPI user is a potential cloud customer. The team's passion is palpable, from Savannah's dual commitment to CPython and cloud tooling, to Jonathan's willingness to write Go so Python developers never have to think about Kubernetes, to Sebastian's thoughtful reframing of open-source sustainability through the "bus ticket factor." For Python developers tired of the ever-growing complexity of cloud deployment, FastAPI Cloud promises something refreshingly Pythonic: just run one command and get back to building.

It was amazing. 05:29 It was a live achievement. I wrote a viral tweet. So yeah, nice to meet you all. 05:34 You know what? Sometimes your moment in the sun is not the one you expected. 05:37 No, congratulations on how good FastAPI is. 05:40 On the tweet. 05:41 Exactly. You really nailed it. Patrick, welcome to the show. 05:45 Nice to be here. Yeah, I'm Patrick. 05:47 I guess the main thing I'm kind of known for in the community is like this library called 05:50 Storary, which is similar to FastAPI, but instead of REST is for GraphQL. 05:55 Other than that, I help organize PyCon Italy and I used to also do EuroPython as well, 06:00 but I stopped because of way too many things. 06:03 Yeah, that's pretty much me. 06:05 How do you see GraphQL these days? 06:07 Is it still popular? 06:08 I think it's mostly popular in the enterprises, unfortunately. 06:12 I'm a bit, to be honest, I'm a bit annoyed about the companies that do tooling around 06:16 GraphQL because I don't know, I feel like they're not really pushing it forward. They're just, 06:20 I don't know, trying to work with enterprises and that's it. Or maybe people think to AI. 06:25 Yeah. It feels a little bit like the soap, soap, wisdom, XML, modern version. Savannah. 06:33 Yeah. 06:34 You like tapping out of being an organizer for EuroPython is like, you know, the classic 06:40 open source oversubscribed doing all the things very relatable. 06:44 Yeah. 06:45 Yeah. 06:45 But yeah, I'm Savannah. 06:46 What can I say? 06:47 I am on the Python Steering Council for 2096, which is very exciting. 06:52 Congratulations. 06:53 Oh, thank you. 06:53 I am also the release manager for the upcoming version of Python, Python 3.16. 06:59 And so that'll kick off later this year, which is really cool and very exciting. 07:04 I work on CPython stuff, the JIT, arg parse, basically whatever needs help. 07:09 It's kind of where you'll find me. 07:09 Awesome. 07:10 Congratulations on the Steering Council. 07:12 And yeah, that's a lot of cool stuff. 07:15 Hopefully we don't get a Python 4.0 right after 3.16 because then your job will never end, is what I've learned. 07:23 Yeah, yeah. 07:23 Benjamin Peterson, Python 2.7 forever kind of situation. 07:28 Yeah, yeah. 07:29 I mean, release management is still, I mean, it's still quite a commitment. 07:33 It's like seven-ish years when you think about all the staggered releases 07:36 because you're a release manager 2.0 and then you have the five-year maintenance cycle. 07:41 So yeah, it's Python forever is what I only said. 07:45 Yeah, it's probably not a fad. 07:47 It's probably going to stick around, this Python thing. 07:50 No, that's awesome. 07:51 Congratulations. 07:51 Also, cool with arg parse. 07:54 I feel like that's making a strong comeback now that we have these AI things that can just put stuff together for us instead of like, oh, I need to depend on this library and that library. 08:04 Like, I just need to take a few arguments and have a little help text. 08:08 And it's like, well, you've already got this built-in thing. 08:10 Oh, who knew? 08:11 You know, people are like, oh, I didn't even know. 08:12 I thought I used typer or click or something, right? 08:15 There's, you know, the typers and clicks of the world. 08:18 But sometimes you just want the simplest thing. 08:20 And ArgParse is pretty great at that. 08:22 Although it has many quirks that are probably and most definitely unfixable at this point. 08:28 Because bugs are features when you have things that have been around as long as Python. 08:32 But yeah, no, I mean, AI loves to write Python. 08:35 I think it's like the language used the most, AI-generated code. 08:39 I'll just say we live in weird times, very weird times. 08:42 I would love a precedented time at some time. 08:45 Exactly. 08:46 Yeah. 08:46 Can we just get the boring times? 08:48 No, nothing interesting, please. 08:49 What I said about GraphQL may sound like a bit of a smash, but I didn't mean it in a negative, 08:56 super negative way anyway. 08:57 Like it used to be all the enterprises were all about soap and wisdom and like subscribing 09:02 your tooling. 09:03 Please don't write me. 09:04 I'm not trying to bash on your technology. 09:07 All right. 09:08 Jonathan, also welcome. 09:10 Hi. 09:10 Yeah, I'm not nearly as famous as everyone else in this call. 09:14 I'm more infamous internally at FastAPI Cloud, I would say, for a bunch of things. 09:21 I've heard of emojis or something along the lines of line. 09:23 One Mima way. 09:24 You're just one Mima way. 09:25 Just one Mima way. 09:27 Yeah, that's true. 09:28 We keep piling them up internally. 09:30 But yeah, I used to work with Patrick together for years, also on Craftia. 09:34 Same library as him. 09:35 That's how I know him. 09:36 And that's why I, well, made a weird sound when you said soap. 09:41 I've been with FastAPI Cloud since EuroPattern, actually, the last one. 09:45 I promised Sebastian I would implement server-send events in FastAPI, 09:48 and I haven't started with it yet at all, but somehow I'm still here. 09:54 So that's great. 09:55 Well, actually, yeah, and it was actually like a sneak peek, I guess. 10:00 We already started having a bunch of chats and discussing what we do. 10:04 Should we do it here? Should we do it there? 10:06 What should we do? 10:07 So like, yeah, it's something that is coming to FastAPI probably soon-ish. 10:11 Like there was a lot of things that needed to happen before that. 10:14 Like Patrick is slightly smiley, like, oh no, this is pressure. 10:19 There were some things that needed to happen in FastAPI, as you know, dropping support for 10:23 Pydantic version one or things like that, that just made the internal code so complex. 10:28 And now that it's over, we can actually work more on improving performance, adding features 10:33 and things like that. 10:34 I definitely want to dive into how FastAPI Cloud has sort of influenced the whole FastAPI side of things. 10:43 But I made aware that there is, in fact, an entire website, an entire website dedicated to the meme. 10:51 Yeah. And out in the audience, we get, hey, everyone, is that the guy from the meme? 10:54 And meme is greater than Nobel Prize. 10:57 So, you know what? 10:59 It may be true. 11:00 It may be true. 11:01 I recognize the person saying, this is the guy from the Ming. 11:04 He might be my husband. 11:09 Incredible. 11:11 Incredible. 11:12 All right, well, let's start with FastAPI Cloud, and then we'll bring it back around to the FastAPI. 11:19 Let's talk origin story. 11:21 So what is this FastAPI Cloud? 11:23 Nice. 11:24 So if you were looking at the FastAPI Labs website, 11:27 that doesn't really show that much. 11:29 If you click on the join the waiting list that takes you to the website for FastAPI Cloud, 11:34 there we can see this is what we are building. 11:36 This is the thing that we are doing. 11:39 It's actually super simple. 11:40 The funny thing is that the pitch, the explanation of the product is so short. 11:44 So it's one command. 11:45 It's FastAPI Deploy. 11:46 You have a FastAPI app, you just hit FastAPI Deploy, and then it's on the cloud. 11:51 We take care of everything. 11:52 We build a thing, deploy it, handle HTTPS, auto-scaling, all this stuff. 11:57 and then you can just like focus on building the application, 12:01 building apps. 12:01 The funny thing is that it's super short to explain, 12:03 but then building it is so cold, Blake. 12:06 I'm glad it's so short. 12:07 So thanks for being here. 12:08 That was a great show, y'all. 12:09 Well, no, just kidding. 12:11 I think it's a little bit like Jupyter Notebooks in that sense that like you all are taking one for the team 12:18 so that other people can have a simple experience. 12:22 Whereas, you know, it's like those Jupyter folks, they write tons of TypeScript and do all sorts of things 12:27 that nobody wants to necessarily do in the data science space 12:31 so that you can just drag your widgets around. 12:33 You know what I mean? 12:33 I think that is a great analogy. 12:35 I feel like the deployment space, it's a bit of a mixed bag. 12:39 And I've been really frustrated to the point such that I wrote a book about it, 12:45 that I think about an alternative, that I think over the last five plus years, 12:51 it's just trended towards a little more complex, a little more complex. 12:56 could we just add one of these things? 12:57 And oh, now we got these three. 12:58 We need one more thing to like make sure those things are doing, you know what I mean? 13:02 And it's just like, wow, why are there 200 choices in my console to use this? 13:07 Which is like kind of funny, right? 13:08 Because I feel like a lot of these companies started with this, like, 13:12 I don't want to understand all the ins and outs of all the infrastructure 13:15 that comes with the cloud service provider. 13:17 And that's really complicated to understand because I'm an app dev 13:19 and I don't know anything about, you know, whatever, right? 13:22 Now we're like, I don't know, kind of slowly accumulating. 13:25 complexity but i think one of the cool things about what we're building and i like i've worked 13:30 on cloud tooling before is like this is like just spoke for python developers and i think that's like 13:35 quite like unique in that like we are really trying to like bring the bleeding edge and like 13:41 all the new tooling that people are using and making sure that we play well with like uv and 13:45 like i think like the there's a lot of thought and care put into that by the team that's a super good 13:52 point. I mean, I remember Azure came out with like, here's your platform as a service. You just 13:57 upload your web app and we'll just take it and go. And now that thing is so complicated along with 14:01 many, many others, right? It's not just them. It's you've got AWS, you've got Vercel. There's 14:06 lots of things we could point at for, wow, there's a lot of options here, you know? 14:09 And then there are a lot of tools and like, you know, like many tools and many companies are also 14:14 like doing a great job at many of the things that they are doing. But in many cases, it's just so 14:18 complex, it's so complicated. 14:19 You know, like I was, I have always been so, what, so adamant, I think is the word, to 14:25 just teaching people how to use the tools. 14:28 I think I have the most documentation about how to deploy things on your own than any other 14:33 framework. 14:34 I have so much information. 14:35 MARK MANDEL: I hear that all the time from people. 14:37 They say one of the reasons they chose FastAPIs is because how clear the documentation 14:41 was, you know? 14:41 FRANCESC CAMPOY: And then the thing is, you know, like just learning all those concepts 14:45 and learning all the stuff that needs to be learned 14:47 just to deploy something, and then you barely have the minimum. 14:51 It's like, this is just too much. 14:53 It's too much complacency. 14:54 I think for me, I guess personally, my analogy is that FastAPI Cloud 15:00 is the equivalent of what FastAPI is to building web APIs and backend. 15:06 You could do the same with any other framework. 15:08 You could validate data. 15:09 You could generate open API. 15:11 You could have automatic docs, But you will probably have to do a lot of the wiring yourself and making sure that it's actually correct and that it doesn't explode, all that stuff. 15:19 That is, you know, like we are trying to do a lot of that work for the final users. 15:25 Yeah, and I think it's great. 15:27 I think it's really nice to just provide this on-ramp because, as you said at the opening, when I asked, you know, what the origin story is just FastAPI deploy. 15:37 That solves so many stories. 15:38 But I'm sure behind the scenes, what happens is just about as simple as that. 15:44 Oh my gosh. 15:45 About that. 15:48 Some of us don't even get to write Python anymore to make all of this happen. 15:52 So speaking about taking one for the team. 15:56 Yeah, that is taking one for a team, right? 15:57 It is. 16:00 This portion of Talk Python To Me is brought to you by us. 16:02 I'm thrilled to announce a brand new app built for developers created by yours truly. 16:07 It's called Command Book. 16:09 You know that thing you do every morning? 16:11 Open up six terminal tabs, CD into this directory, activate that virtual environment, 16:16 run the server with --reload. 16:18 Now, CD somewhere else, start the background worker, another tab for Docker, another one to tail production logs. 16:24 Every tab just says Python, Python, Python, Docker tail. 16:28 And you're clicking through them going, which Python was that again? 16:31 Where my app is running? 16:32 Then sometime later, your dev server silently dies because it tried to reload 16:36 while you're in the middle of a code edit, unmatched brace, a half-written import, or something. 16:42 Now you're hunting through tabs to figure out which process crashed and how to restart it. 16:46 My app, CommandBook, gives all of these long-running commands a permanent home. 16:51 You save a command once, the working directory, the environment, 16:54 three commands like git pull, and from then on, you just click run. 16:58 You can even group commands together to start and stop everything for a project 17:01 with a single click. 17:02 It also has what I call honey badger mode, auto restart on crash. 17:07 so when your dev server goes down mid-reload, Command Book just brings it right back up 17:12 and does so over and over until the code is fixed. 17:15 It also detects URLs from your output so you're never scrolling through thousands of lines of logs 17:19 just to figure out how to reopen your web app. 17:22 And it shows you uptime, memory usage, and all sorts of cool things about your process. 17:26 The whole thing is a native macOS app. 17:28 No Electron, no Chromium, just 21 megs. 17:31 And it comes with a full CLI so anything you've configured in the UI, 17:35 you can fire off from your terminal with just a single command. 17:38 Right now, it's macOS only, but if there's enough interest, 17:41 I'll build a Windows version too, so let me know. 17:44 Please check it out at talkpython.fm/commandbook app. 17:49 Download it for free, level up your developer workflow. 17:52 The link is in your podcast player's show notes. 17:54 That's talkpython.fm/commandbook. 17:56 I really hope you enjoy this new app that I built. 18:00 Let's save the internals for a little bit later. 18:02 Maybe what we could do right now, Maybe we could do a bit of a walkthrough of just kind of what it's like to set up an app from scratch, right? 18:12 Nice. 18:12 I see that uv is here, which is, I've been certainly an advocate for uv in all sorts of deployment, 18:20 but especially when you have like repeated build type of scenarios for like Docker, 18:26 Docker Compose or Kubernetes or whatever, uv makes that stuff so much faster and so on. 18:31 So who would like to be my guide that just kind of talks us through what it means to set up a new project here? 18:37 I mean, there is like this really nice command that Savannah built, just FastAPI new, 18:41 which I think is something like, I don't know, like super helpful. 18:45 What does FastAPI new do? 18:46 Like, is that kind of a cookie cutter-esque experience or what is it? 18:51 Yes, exactly. 18:52 At the moment, Onesco holds a super basic FastAPI application using uv. 18:57 It also installs dependencies, creates a folder, everything that you need. 19:00 In future, I think we're going to plan support for templates 19:03 so you can build multiple kind of things as well. 19:06 But for now, it's just basically just uv FastAPI new, 19:09 sorry, uvx FastAPI new, and then that scaffolds the project for you. 19:12 I don't know if you want to try it live or... 19:14 No, go ahead. 19:15 Just, I would think it might disrupt you. 19:18 Just let's talk us through it. 19:19 It could work. 19:20 I'm just going to put that out there. 19:21 I'll tell you the most insane, like let's do that live on the podcast experience. 19:25 I'm pretty sure, yeah, this is definitely the most insane. 19:28 I had Matthew Rocklin on from Coiled, and those guys are all about like, hey, we're going to scale up like a bunch of available servers for you, right? 19:36 So that you can do your data science. 19:38 Like I want to do some ML thing, and it needs 500 servers. 19:41 So during the podcast, he's, oh, let me just spin up 2,000 EC2 instances. 19:45 Hold on. 19:47 And then we ran some code on it during the show. 19:49 And he's like, oh, let's try that on ARM. 19:50 And then spin up another 2,000 on ARM Linux machines. 19:53 I'm like, okay, that's nuts. 19:55 But let's just. 19:56 That's a lot of power. 19:57 So I was impressed, but Patrick, sorry, I kind of did realty there. 20:02 Let's talk through it. 20:03 Yeah, so you do uvx FastAPI app, FastAPI new, then you specify the name of the application. 20:08 And that's almost there. 20:10 You just need one more command to deploy, which is FastAPI deploy. 20:13 The first time it's going to ask you to log in or join the waiting list if you haven't been invited yet. 20:17 It's still in beta. 20:19 And then you follow the steps. 20:21 So like FastAPI deploy, log in, decide the team. 20:25 If you have multiple teams, design the application name, 20:28 and then you wait a few seconds and the application is going to be live. 20:31 And just to be clear, FastAPI new is not required if you already have a FastAPI app. 20:36 If you've already written your own code and you have your application, 20:40 you can just go right into logging in and deploying. 20:43 This is just so that if you're starting something new, 20:46 you don't have to do any thinking about all the right things that need to be there. 20:50 So this is more of a greenfield application. 20:52 I'm bootstrapping a project. 20:54 Right, right, because you want to have the best structure. 20:57 Now, it uses uv. 20:59 It is nodes required. 21:00 Yeah, I was going to say, do I have to use the uv project management type of thing? 21:04 Do I have to use the uv.lock files and uv add uv sync? 21:08 Can I do requirements.txt? 21:09 What's the story there? 21:10 Yes, so we support uv with uv lock. 21:13 We also support the, forget the name, the other, the PyLock file. 21:17 And we also support plain requirements.txt. 21:19 And maybe something else, I don't know, Jonathan, can you? 21:22 PyLock's pretty new, right? 21:23 I think Brett Cannon just got that out pretty recently, right? 21:26 Brett was pretty excited. 21:27 I know. 21:29 Implemented that. 21:30 Oh, was he? 21:30 Okay, I'm sure he was. 21:31 That's awesome. 21:32 He put years of work into that. 21:33 And he also said that one of the motivations was also like, you know, like cloud providers. 21:38 So it's like, yes. 21:40 The other thing is like, you know, if you use other different package managers, if they use the standard PyProject Autonomous format, that will also be supported. 21:49 That means that, you know, like if you use PDM or if you use poetry with one of the recent versions, like that will work. 21:56 If you use a very old version of poetry or like you use some other strange package manager or something, that will probably be problematic. 22:03 But for like most of the use cases that use the standard package formats, it will just work. 22:08 And if you use uv, then like you're going to have the best experience because we are fans of uv and Astro. 22:14 They've definitely put a dent in the way that sort of Python gets started and making that a lot easier. 22:19 So it totally makes sense. 22:21 And also, I noticed, speaking of uv, that there's, at least in the recommended way, or the way in the docs, let's say, 22:29 it doesn't say, here's how you install FastAPI. 22:32 You just, here's how you run FastAPI-new, leveraging uv, which then will silently install and manage. 22:42 All right, that's pretty neat. 22:43 That helps you guys tell a simpler story, right? 22:47 Instead of, here's how you create the virtual environment to install our thing and so on, you know? 22:51 The idea is to make it like, as I was saying, just super simple for people just to start from scratch. 22:56 Like no idea how to create an app, how to start, how to create an environment. 23:00 It's just you run this command and you're off to go. 23:03 Off to the races, I'm missing sands. 23:06 Anyway, that's what Colombians do. 23:09 But then if you already have an app, you have like, you know, like anything with FastAPI standard installed, then like that also just works. 23:18 And Savannah, you pointed out that it doesn't have to be a new project. 23:21 If you want to start from an existing one, that's totally fine. 23:24 But what do I got to do if I'm starting from, if I'm migrating an existing one? 23:29 Like how easy or hard is this? 23:30 I have some like legacy project demo apps I've built at other companies I've worked with that have used FastAPI. 23:37 And I literally just ran like FastAPI login and then FastAPI deploy and it just worked, which felt really magical. 23:44 Right. Like I think that's like, I don't know, like having worked on cloud products for quite a while, like I think one of the biggest gaps is like the just I don't know, like the disparity between like my local dev environment and what is actually like lives up in the cloud somewhere. 23:59 And so being able to just run one command and having the project as it exists on my machine go and work somewhere without having to think about like the infrastructure. 24:08 And of course, like, you know, we want to be like amenable to folks who do want a little bit, you know, like higher touch. 24:15 But we also want to work for people who are like learning FastAPI and Python, right? 24:19 Like educators and people that are teaching Python. 24:22 I think this is like something that you've had some interest in as well from those folks. 24:26 Yeah, I was just listening to the Teaching Python podcast books just the other day and thinking, you know, like this, when I look at this, I know this is not necessarily your focus, but certainly people who are trying to teach a class, be it college class or high school class or whatever. 24:44 And if you build anything on the web, the next question is, this is cool. 24:49 How do I share it with people? 24:50 And then they're like, oh, no. 24:52 Oh, no. 24:53 Hold on. 24:54 Like coding boot camps, right? 24:55 Like if you're teaching someone how to write Python or how to build an API with FastAPI, 25:02 like actually setting up the environment for them to deploy is not part of it, right? 25:06 Like that's not actually part of the curriculum. 25:08 It's like this peripheral thing that ends up eating up a bunch of the educator's time or 25:12 the student's time trying to understand both like how to write code and then also understand 25:16 cloud stuff. 25:17 And that's like a lot to ask people when they're fresh up the gate. 25:20 I feel the same way about like tutorials and stuff at conferences. 25:24 Yeah, totally. 25:25 Yeah. Or training sessions. If you're doing like corporate training or like, they're all like, 25:29 Oh, well, let's get everybody's machine working. There goes an hour and whatever. But yeah, 25:36 if you can just say, look, I think when you're either, when you're trying to learn something, 25:40 you'll be it through school or on your own or through these like more structured ways, 25:46 like bootcamps and training and so on. I think if it's not the main purpose, 25:51 I feel so often there's like, we're going to do 20 steps for four hours before you get any sort of 25:56 reward of what you've done. And if you can go, okay, do you have it running? Okay, now you run 26:01 this command. Look, now it's on the internet. Like, oh, wait, awesome. I got an app on the internet. 26:05 Everybody look at me. You know what I mean? And I think shortening that cycle to where people can 26:10 have that aha moment. And then later they can dive into like, well, how is it really working? And what 26:14 do we really need to understand? But that quick iteration cycle, especially in the early parts of 26:21 in new tech. It's really important. But also, you know, like down the line as well, I think, 26:25 like, I don't know, there are so many things that I have been wanting to build and I don't, 26:29 but I didn't because it was just so complex to deploy stuff. You know, like knowing, 26:34 knowing how to do the whole thing, how to set up the clusters, the machines, install the Linux 26:40 systems, deploy the cluster, whatever, like all that stuff, deploy the things, 26:44 handling load balancers and HTTPS. I'm like, you know, like I know how to do that. I built one of 26:49 the most popular websites teaching how to use Docker to ARM, which was like the contender 26:54 before Kubernetes won everything. 26:56 I like it. 26:57 But still, it's just so complicated, like doing all those steps that are like, yeah, no, I'll 27:02 just not do it. 27:04 Like some other day. 27:05 Now I can just like play around and do random stuff and just like deploy when it just works. 27:09 It is, I really like that. 27:11 I guess like coming back to that, like taking one for the team point earlier, like I feel 27:16 like building Python tooling. It's kind of like taking one for the team sometimes because you have 27:20 these folks that are like, you know, brand new to Python. Like Python is an extremely approachable 27:26 language for people who are new to writing code. But then, you know, we also want to make FastAPI 27:30 cloud work for someone that's building like an enterprise grade application, right? And so like, 27:35 like pretty wide spectrum of folks with like a million different use cases and different types 27:41 of applications they want to deploy with different constraints and like security stuff. 27:46 And like, so yeah, I think, I don't know, maybe that's just like Python tooling. 27:50 It's a lot of work, I guess, to like build something that works for the masses. 27:54 Yeah, well, it's certainly tough to make something that feels simple, 27:57 but it's not overly simplistic, you know, that can actually solve the problems. 28:01 Has the right knobs for the right users too, right? 28:04 I would argue we're not only trying to do it simple and easy. 28:08 I feel like we're choosing a particular flavor of simple, which is... 28:13 We have this discussion a few times. 28:15 It's like, if you make a cloud, how do we make it feel Pythonic? 28:18 What does that mean in a cloud setting? 28:20 We talk about Pythonic libraries, Pythonic coding style in the community a lot. 28:25 And now we kind of try to transfer that flavor, that feeling to the cloud 28:29 and make everything around that feel just like we want our libraries to feel. 28:34 So you feel at home as a Python developer and it just feels right. 28:37 So that's extra step on top of making it simple. 28:40 And we discuss that a lot. 28:41 That's how I feel about it. 28:42 I love it. 28:43 I think it's one of the coolest things about this team. 28:47 Like, you know, like people are being able to hear a few of us. 28:50 There's like, there are like a bunch of others, but like that each one of us is so passionate 28:55 about the things that we are working on. 28:57 So like, you know, like each one of us is trying to make the best out of the things that 29:01 we are building. 29:02 And then like, we are so passionate about the thing that we care about and that we are building. 29:07 that I think that ends up being an amazing result. 29:11 For example, the CLI. 29:12 We wanted to have some specific, you know, like behavior, 29:17 some look and feel. 29:18 And like we wanted to be able to have like the best kind of CLIs. 29:22 So Patrick went ahead and built this bunch of tooling 29:25 that we needed to be able to have it and like made it open source and everything. 29:29 So we could have this great experience when working with CLIs. 29:33 Jonathan recently was doing so much stuff about the something that caches and handling security, 29:38 making sure that everything was super secure, super fast, super snappy. 29:42 You know, like Alejandra is super careful about all the UI. 29:46 Martin is super careful about all the infra. 29:49 You know, it's like this passionate mess, which is a word I just made up. 29:57 This, Alejandra goes and says, like, this thing doesn't have the proper margins. 30:01 We need to increase this a little bit. 30:02 I don't like it. 30:04 She just goes and fixes it. 30:05 The same with Marvin. 30:06 He says, like, we need to have, like, this sort of thing in infrastructure. 30:09 And, like, just comes and tells me, hey, we are doing this. 30:12 And he's like, yes, sir. 30:13 Like this with the OpenVPN, like, Unix, for example, 30:16 that is mainly focused on the open source, is constantly looking at all the discussions, PRs, conversations, 30:22 making sure that everything that we do, that doesn't. 30:24 So why, you know, like, there have been, like, recently way more releases of FastAPI friends of the open source projects 30:31 and very fast book fixes, very fast responses to handle everything for the community. 30:37 Now we actually have people that is paying attention constantly 30:40 to what is happening, what are the things that we have to do, 30:43 and that really care about that part as well. 30:46 So I think this extreme care about what we are doing. 30:50 You know, like Savannah is making Python. 30:53 This detail that each one of us cares so, so much about each one of the things that we build, 30:59 making sure that the product is actually amazing. 31:01 It's as good as it can be, and we can all feel at home when... 31:06 I get so excited for talking about it because I really enjoy the end result of the product 31:12 and of being able to use it. 31:13 I would use it in the end. 31:15 I would use to work with it. 31:16 It's super simple. 31:17 Yeah, that's awesome. 31:18 Hey, let me adjust your mic real quick. 31:20 I think it was like ducking, ducking out a little bit. 31:23 We just went through a lot, a lot of content and a lot of sweating 31:26 because your microphone went through like six different stages of weirdness. 31:31 I think that really leads to like something I wanted to talk about is just what impact has this had on FastAPI? 31:39 And before you jump in and answer that question, everyone, there's especially I think with Astral, 31:44 but with because they've had so much success, there's been an undercurrent of concern of like, 31:49 oh, my gosh, commercialism is getting into our open source. 31:53 And what if it pollutes it and causes these negative aspects? 31:57 But just hearing all of the energy around FastAPI with so many people, 32:03 because of FastAPI Cloud, that's super neat. 32:05 So I wanted to throw out to you all, how has this building FastAPI Cloud and the existence of FastAPI Cloud 32:12 been giving back to FastAPI, I guess? 32:14 I'm waiting to see if someone will speak FastAPI. 32:18 I'm always the one that is speaking the most. 32:22 I mean, it might be your project. 32:24 Like, you may have started the project. 32:25 Yeah, maybe so. 32:27 Like, last year, I had, like, a few keynotes in some picons in different places. 32:31 And, like, one of the key points that I wanted to bring was this idea that I'm trying to show that, in many cases, people worry about the boss factor. 32:41 And the boss factor is just this idea. 32:43 Yes, yes, I've heard this, yes. 32:45 Yeah, you know, like, the boss factor is the idea that, oh, what happens if, like, there's one person doing this work? 32:51 What happens if a boss runs over this person? 32:54 And there's so much worry about this boss factor. 32:58 It's sort of a morbid analogy, but I understand, right? 33:02 Like, what will happen to the open source project if the maintainer vanishes for some reason, right? 33:07 Exactly. 33:08 But, you know, like, it also applies to projects and to many other different things. 33:11 But what I think is that it's a disproportionate amount of attention to this detail of the boss factor. 33:19 And I think every time people talk about the boss factor, you know, like one of my points in what I was trying to say in these talks was I would like people to think about the boss ticket factor. 33:30 Who is paying for those tickets? 33:32 It doesn't matter how big is the team. 33:34 You know, like you have seen Google, Amazon, Meta, all the big ones. 33:38 They don't have a small boost factor. 33:40 They have a lot of people in their payroll and still they finish products. 33:45 They just cancel them. 33:46 Open source or private or whatever. 33:49 is not the main factor defining the success of a project, 33:55 being it commercial or open source of any type, is not really how many people are behind it. 34:00 It's more of what is the value that whoever is putting the effort to keep it alive 34:05 is getting from putting all that effort. 34:07 It could be just satisfaction. 34:09 It could be like open source, like, oh, I feel so good that I'm contributing to society. 34:13 And that is valid. 34:14 It doesn't pay the rent, but it's still valid. 34:17 It might last for a while. 34:18 But then also like, you know, like when you see like there are so many Python projects, so many Python, so many open source projects that can do well or can do bad. 34:26 And it doesn't really depend on how many people they have. 34:28 And when you are using a project, when you're using an open source project or when you are using a product of any type, I will encourage you to think about what is the best ticket factor of this project? 34:41 What are the things that whoever is building this is receiving in exchange for giving it away? 34:47 So like, you know, like what are they expecting to sell you at some point? 34:52 Or what are they receiving in exchange? 34:55 You know, for example, Bun, the JavaScript Brompton LiDAR. 34:58 Like it was like, we don't know what they're going to sell. 35:01 But now, you know, Cloud and Entropic really want to have like this thing keep working because they are using it internally. 35:07 So you can say like, OK, I'm going to use it. 35:09 I'm going to use it for free. 35:10 I know that what they receive for me using is just like that they just really want it. 35:15 So I can just like, whenever you are using bond, you are getting, now you are getting free services 35:20 from Antropoc, that's it. 35:21 But you know, like every time you are using a project, 35:24 you can think about why are people receiving an exchange 35:27 for giving this away for me? 35:28 This is like the thing that I would like people to think about, you know, like also like 35:34 how can they give back? 35:35 Maybe they can actually contribute to that community 35:38 or to that project. 35:38 There are many ways and in many cases, the thing that is needed the most is just like help 35:43 and work, just answering questions and issues. 35:47 this portion of talk python enemy is brought to you by us i'm excited to talk about my first solo 35:52 book talk python in production it's an inside look at how we host all the talk python sites 35:58 apis mobile apps and way more here's the thing i believe most hosting stories sold to developers 36:03 and data scientists are way over complicated and overpriced you've heard me say you're not google 36:09 you're not netflix so you shouldn't run your infrastructure the way they do but if not that 36:13 then what? This book is both a blueprint for what I chose for Talk Python and a story arc of 10 years 36:20 of running my own infrastructure from a complete newbie, apprehensive to Linux, to some pretty 36:25 neat infrastructures code DevOps. It covers Docker, Nginx, Let's Encrypt, self-hosted analytics and 36:32 monitoring, CDN setup, framework migrations, and a whole philosophy that I've termed stack native, 36:38 keeping things streamlined, powerful, and free of cloud lock-in. And it's more than just your 36:43 standard tech book. It comes with code and figure galleries on GitHub, a discussion forum, and 36:48 something unique, over an hour of audio readers briefs, short conversations that bookend each 36:54 chapter to prime your focus or broaden your takeaways. Oh, and 0% of this book was written 37:00 by AI. Every word is mine, written over the course in high months, for better or worse. 37:04 I've made the first third of the book available for free online. After that, you can grab the DRM 37:09 free EPUB and Kindle editions. And I'm working on a paperback edition as well. Please check it out 37:15 at talkpython.fm/DevOps, or just click book in the nav bar on the website. It's a great way to 37:20 support the podcast. And I hope it changes a bit how you think about running your apps in production. 37:26 Kind of related to what you're saying, I think one of the angles that I really appreciate about 37:30 the way we think about FastAPI and FastAPI Cloud is like where like a lot of our team was involved 37:36 in open source before coming to work at FastAPI Cloud on various projects around the Python 37:41 ecosystem, outside of Python. 37:42 And I think all of us have deep appreciation and understanding of the value of open source 37:48 and really, really try and build in a way that is like, I mean, Sebastian, you've talked 37:53 about this a lot, but solving a real problem for folks, right? 37:56 And so FastAPI Cloud is sort of this extension of this open source ecosystem people would 38:01 be using. 38:03 FastAPI Cloud may be an option. 38:05 Maybe someone picks some other cloud for some reason. 38:07 I don't think like, I think we're all very mindful of that. 38:10 But like the angle that's very cool, I think, is that like, because we all work at FastAPI Cloud, 38:15 like I know that I personally have time, more time for my open source work 38:19 and my employer understands the value of my open source work, 38:23 which isn't that positive for the open source community. 38:25 Like I get to work on CPython sometimes and I have, you know, the bandwidth 38:29 to go and do my steering council work or upcoming release management work. 38:33 I understand like this sort of like, tempering, like open source, commercial, bad, all bad. 38:39 It's not all bad. 38:40 It's actually like really good in a lot of cases for folks to build business. 38:43 Look at uv for an example to hold up, right? 38:46 Astral, yeah, yeah, totally. 38:47 Yeah, yeah. 38:48 I think there are some really good examples of this. 38:50 So I think like that's another angle that, I mean, I really, I get a lot of energy out of our team 38:55 because we all, I don't have to, I don't have to fight the open source battle 38:59 at FastAPI Cloud. 39:01 I think that's really cool. 39:02 I do think that's super cool as well. 39:03 Let me put out two examples for you. 39:05 here that I think everyone will be aware of as sort of to add to what Sebastian was saying is 39:12 look how much Apple freaked out when Steve Jobs died and how many people work at Apple, right? 39:17 Like that was still like, oh my gosh. But, you know, I think there's, they're hanging in there. 39:23 They're going to be probably making it. They are not in our business. I tell you what, 39:27 they got some of my money. That's for sure. But also, you know, look at Flask, right? Armin 39:35 drifted away, which is totally fine. And David Lord and Pallets picked it up and kept running, 39:41 right? Like it's still one of the most popular frameworks out there, right? So it's, I think 39:46 the bus factor is over, overblown a bit, but also looking at the team of folks here, I think it's, 39:51 it's even more obvious that there's a bunch of people who are on the inside, you know? 39:54 For example, Flask, you know, like I learned so many things from Flask and like, the thing is, 39:59 I feel like sometimes, sometimes people go and complain about the tool and say like, oh, 40:04 this is not working for this or for that. And in many cases, it's in this insensitive way towards 40:09 the people that are working on that. And it's like, you know, like in the end, realize that 40:13 there's actually people behind the scenes doing the work. And like, in many cases, it's just like 40:17 one or two people doing a lot of work in many cases, just for free. And, you know, like, I think 40:22 it's worth calling that out. Like all the work that David Lord does for Flask is just like so 40:27 much work. And yeah, deserves a lot of respect. I totally agree. The other thing that I forgot to 40:32 mention is that there are so many ideas of potential products that I could build over the years, and I 40:37 never did, and I never started a company because I didn't have clarity of what will be a good thing 40:43 to actually sell and will have a good alignment. The cloud product has such a good alignment with 40:49 the open source side because as more successful FastAPI is, the more successful FastAPI cloud 40:57 has a potential to be. 40:59 The more people using Python effectively, the more people might end up checking out FastAPI 41:05 and the more people might end up checking out the product. 41:08 So if FastAPI does well, if the open source does well, 41:11 if Python does well, that's better for the company. 41:13 So it doesn't really depend on my personal principles 41:17 and values or something like that. 41:19 It's aligned with, it's financially aligned with the company. 41:24 So it's just going to be beneficial in the end It doesn't depend on good intentions. 41:30 And FastAPI is open source. 41:31 It has like 7,000 forks or something. 41:34 So if a boost runs over me, there are 7,000 forks. 41:38 It's not going away. 41:39 I definitely agree with you on that. 41:40 I feel like I should maybe give a little bit of a, I'll tell a little bit of the story 41:45 of what's going on with, where did I put it? 41:47 I don't think I pasted it over here, is what's going on with Tailwind right now. 41:51 And I think Tailwind is having a tough time, Tailwind CSS. 41:55 Traffic to Tailwind is up six times year over year on npm downloads. 42:02 But the revenue of Tailwind is down five times. 42:07 You know, I mean, these are completely out of whack things because instead of people going 42:11 to docs to learn about it, it's just like, well, when you go to the docs, you learn they 42:15 also have premium offerings, right? 42:17 And I think you guys are different because it's not just, oh, here's a little bit nicer 42:22 of a thing, right? 42:23 I feel like it would be a little bit as if you were selling cookie cutter templates for FastAPI apps, you know, it's like, well, the AI can make the shape of the thing that comes out of the cookie cutter, to be honest. 42:34 But you're offering something that has ongoing value that it costs more and is more complex in other places. 42:42 And so I think maybe just thinking about the how this just keeps the team going for FastAPI is really awesome. 42:50 And I think it's got a nice flywheel effect there. 42:53 is I'll link to this, I guess, audio track. 42:56 I don't know what I call it. 42:57 It's a blog post that has one sentence, but a 30-minute audio you can check out 43:01 from the guy, Adam, who's one of the founders of Tailwind, 43:04 talking about going into this. 43:06 It's kind of rough. 43:07 I think I don't necessarily want to go into a deep AI, 43:10 what it means for the industry. 43:11 Like, let's stay focused on what you guys are doing. 43:13 But I think it's going to be its own series. 43:17 I mean, Stack Overflow had as many questions asked this month as they did in the first month of their existence, right? 43:25 Three or 4,000, whereas at their peak, they were 200,000 questions a month. 43:29 There's like real turmoil that's coming from some of these things, which is tricky. 43:35 But I'm really excited to see you all doing this because I'm a big fan of FastAPI. 43:40 And I think this is just sustaining and more for FastAPI, right? 43:45 Like, what do you all think? 43:46 That's what we hope that is going on. 43:49 I thought about Taiwan for a second, right? 43:52 It's not like we're immune to what happened to them. 43:54 Like we also have a lot of documentation online. 43:56 AI could train on that. 43:58 And if it's good enough, it could maintain your infrastructure and stuff. 44:01 It's just too hard at the moment. 44:03 And there's an additional thing we're kind of selling, which is like, I guess, responsibility. 44:08 Like you're shifting the risk from like letting your AI or your infantry team maintain your infrastructure to us. 44:15 So we're staying up at night and worry about it. 44:18 that has a lot of value as well. 44:20 And that's probably not going to get removed by AI. 44:24 Here's a very common cloud code, cursor, whatever conversation. 44:29 Hey, build me something with Python and needs an API. 44:33 Okay, we built it with FastAPI. 44:34 How do I host it? 44:36 Right, that doesn't just, it will build a cloud for you, right? 44:39 It's going to recommend something out there. 44:41 And a real natural way to how do I host FastAPI is FastAPI cloud, right? 44:46 Like if it suggests, oh, you're just going to like spread it across Lambda by breaking. 44:51 Like, whoa, no, I want something simple. 44:52 Okay, give me FastAPI cloud, right? 44:54 I think that that's a really good thing. 44:55 And then on the enterprise side, enterprise folks are notoriously not good at supporting open source 45:03 in that they're not like paying for it. 45:05 I know some companies are big supporters of the PSF and Python and open source. 45:11 But in general, it's like, yeah, we have this project with 5,000 people working on it. 45:15 It's all Python. 45:16 And are we sponsoring this? 45:19 Nope. 45:20 We're just enjoying the money, right? 45:22 And we're a bank. 45:23 So we got the money. 45:24 We got all the money. 45:25 So they're just not good at paying for like a really great framework that they use a lot. 45:29 But they got plenty of hosting, plenty of internal apps that they just need to make run and stuff. 45:34 So I think both on like the low end and the high end, there's a lot of synergy between these things. 45:40 That is not just, you know, slightly advanced, not to diminish it, but slightly advanced UI widgets that you could ask your AI to build or something or like cookie cutter templates for project starters. 45:52 I think we are in a somewhat fortunate position of like, you know, like FastAPI. FastAPI has grown so much. 45:59 Like, you know, like when you check the statistics about downloads or GitHub stars or entries in developer surveys, 46:06 like it's at the top in like in each category. 46:08 It's like, you know, like the backend framework with the most GitHub stars across languages, 46:14 even like, you know, like Java, Go, Ruby, JS, like whatever. 46:17 It's like the top one, at least in GitHub stars. 46:20 So like, you know, like FastAPI is like people are liking it, fortunately. 46:25 And there's probably going to be people deploying things to FastAPI Cloud. 46:29 So that's probably going to be like, we are probably going to be fine. 46:33 I think, you know, like the, I guess it will be like a good point to ask people to go and 46:38 check where the open source project is that they are using and check where is the bus ticket 46:42 factor for those open source projects. 46:45 You know, like if you are using Tailwind CSS, it would have been very cool if at some point you check if the premium things were useful for you and for your company or your project or something like that, you know? 46:56 Yeah, because what is the thing that keeps that project going? 46:59 Exactly. 47:00 And I really personally admire if a project or something offers like more value, not just, hey, buy me a coffee, but here's a thing that you get way more of, you know? 47:12 And in that regard, I think Tailwind was doing that, right? 47:14 They were offering this suite of pre-built things. 47:17 And I think that that's great. 47:19 But yeah, I do think you've got more of these crazy AI things 47:24 are going to maybe recommend FastAPI Cloud more than they're just going to undercut it. 47:28 So I think that's really great. 47:29 And by the way, I was just looking for the GitHub Stars graph. 47:33 Like there's a whole, I can't remember what the domain of that site is. 47:36 And I ran across, by the way, I just want to give a quick shout out. 47:39 Like your cult repo documentary on FastAPI was awesome. 47:44 Right? 47:44 That was so fun. 47:45 They made me look good. 47:46 I didn't see that coming. 47:47 Yeah, it came right on the heels of the Python official 47:50 documentary, the one hour one. 47:51 This is the same group, and the production quality is really nice. 47:54 So like-- 47:55 When they released the trailer for the Python documentary, 47:58 before releasing the documentary, when they released the trailer, 48:01 they contacted me and said, hey, we're doing these mini documentaries about different frameworks, 48:06 different tools, and we want to include FastAPI there. 48:08 I was like, oh, nice. 48:10 But then I was just trying to stay excited, but super excited. 48:13 Oh, that's so cool. Yeah, I watched it as soon as it came out. So I'll link to that. People should 48:17 definitely, it's only like 10 minutes or something, but it's worth it. We're checking out. So it's not 48:22 a huge investment time. People can watch it, I suppose. It's not TikTok. I mean, it's not like, 48:27 oh, I saw the documentary, but it doesn't take you on huge about it. 48:34 You have to listen for 10 minutes, overly excited Colombian. 48:37 I don't understand what's happened to the attention span of society. I'm really, 48:41 honestly a little concerned. I used to, when I would create my courses, people would say, 48:45 you know, like a four hour course and there'd be like a 10, 15 minute sort of, Hey, here's how you 48:49 set up your computer. And here's all the introduction and people, Oh, that's so awesome. 48:52 I loved how you kind of set the stage. I'm really motivated to take the course. 48:55 Nowadays, I just get messages like, why are you still talking? This is five minutes long. Do you 48:59 understand? I'm like, this is your job. You can't spend five minutes. Oh my gosh. Anyway, that's, 49:06 that's sort of the origin of my comment there. It's all right. So we're kind of getting so much 49:11 time, I think I want to talk about a couple of things. Let's talk a little bit about internals. 49:17 Like what, I don't know who wants to take this one, but let's talk about just how, when I say 49:23 FastAPI deploy, then what? It's just a uv pip install and it just goes and it's magic and it's 49:30 easy, right? We have a nickname for Jonathan. Can we say it or no? I don't know. It's so funny. 49:34 This happened because I told my friends, I'm so concerned about being at the podcast because 49:38 Because everyone here is a visionary, and then I'm the back-end guy. 49:42 I think the things I could contribute to this conversation, I should probably keep to myself. 49:47 But you're just leaking your turnouts, right? 49:50 There are some things that are not really secret. 49:53 Like, as Sebastian said earlier, Kubernetes 1 in the infrastructure and deployment field, to some extent. 50:01 So that's somewhere in there, right? 50:03 But it's all the way deep down, so no one has to worry about it. 50:07 But it's still a foundation. 50:08 which is a good foundation. 50:09 I think one thing that's, you might have guessed it, 50:12 but FastAPI Cloud is built on FastAPI, which kind of makes sense, right? 50:16 And that also has an effect on like recent patches, updates and stuff. 50:20 Because if we find something internally which we're not happy with, 50:24 then we just fix it. 50:25 And that's how some releases came out faster than months before. 50:30 Power of dogfooding. 50:31 Yeah, that's awesome. 50:32 Dogfooding a lot. 50:33 Also all the related libraries like SQL model and, well, others. 50:38 they experience the same thing. 50:40 New library is coming out. 50:42 Patrick will announce at some point soon. 50:43 It's not just FastJPay and friends. 50:45 We're like really open. 50:47 Like recently, Patrick just open-sourced everything we use for authentication authorization, 50:52 for example. 50:52 Is it open-source yet? 50:53 Did they just leak something? 50:55 It will be announced soon at some point. 50:57 We build stuff internally in the moment really. 51:00 Like we build it in a way, like in a separate package, 51:03 just like an open-source library. 51:04 And if we feel like the time is ripe, it's just getting open-sourced 51:07 because a lot of things are reusable. 51:09 And that's in all departments. 51:10 That happens a lot. 51:12 When I started there, I already realized that. 51:14 Everyone was building open source, but now I joined in myself as well. 51:17 I open source the library for compressing and decompressing archives in Python 51:24 because the internal top high thing is just slow and we needed it to be faster 51:28 because we're staring at the deployment process and we're like, hey, we could probably shave off a few seconds here. 51:33 Then that's just open source for everyone to use. 51:35 So we're contributing to the old Python ecosystem as well. 51:38 You have to say the name. 51:40 It's so good. 51:41 Is it good? 51:42 No, it's just, it's faster because it's, you know, faster than just tar. 51:47 Fast tar? 51:48 I love it. 51:48 Fast tar, yes. 51:49 And you can say with that very, very German accent, fast tar. 51:53 I'll go star it. 51:54 We'll get you some stars. 51:56 This is going to happen. 51:57 That's the irony about it. 51:58 Like, it literally has no stars. 52:00 But if you scroll down, you see the downloads. 52:01 That's going to prove we're actually using it. 52:04 Yeah, I like it. 52:05 It's a little context manager. 52:07 It's almost working the same as the TAL file in the standard library. 52:13 Like the same, like almost similar API to that. 52:16 It's basically a drop-in replacement, more or less. 52:19 But they know they need everything to happen in Rust. 52:21 Because Rust. 52:22 Because Rust, yeah. 52:23 Well, as soon as it becomes infrastructure and you've got to run it a million times, 52:27 that starts to make sense, right? 52:29 Yeah. 52:29 Python is one of the fastest programming languages in the world. 52:33 when you think about human time to build the things, right? 52:37 Like that's one of its real superpowers is like, I mean, there's the whole story of Google Video and YouTube, right? 52:44 And Google Video was written in C++ with 100 engineers 52:47 and YouTube was a small team in Python and they just couldn't keep up with the features. 52:51 So they bought this little old thing, YouTube, and see if we're going to make something with it. 52:55 And last I checked, it was still in Python. 52:57 I'm sure some of it isn't, but a few years ago it was, which is wild. 53:00 Anyway, there's different ways of fast, But when it's down to like little utilities, yeah. 53:04 I know some people that are trying to make Python fast. 53:06 I know a couple. 53:07 Yeah. 53:08 And honestly, massive success in the last five years, right? 53:11 Like since 3.11, since the specializing adaptive interpreter, there's been pretty big improvements. 53:17 3.9 and 3.11 did a lot of like foundational work. 53:20 And then 3.9 onward really just uncorked a lot of innovation there. 53:24 Yeah, that's pretty awesome. 53:26 All right. 53:26 It sounds like, Sebastian, you've talked a lot about Kubernetes. 53:29 So I imagine Kubernetes is happening. 53:31 Do we get to pick what data centers it runs on? 53:34 Do we get to pick what clouds it runs on? 53:37 You're going to get to pick some of these things. 53:41 Not yet. 53:42 It's not released yet. 53:43 But, you know, like it's top, of course. 53:45 Like we have like regular cloud providers on the MIT 53:48 and there's a bunch of Kubernetes. 53:49 Then there's a bunch of additional stuff that needs to run on top. 53:53 Then there's like custom Kubernetes controllers and things that Jonathan was saying 53:58 that he's having to write in Go so that people in Python can be happy to be able to, you know, 54:04 like manage all the Kubernetes shenanigans that need to happen 54:07 because there's so much complexity that needs to be handled. 54:10 There's a lot of that. 54:11 We do a lot of advanced tricks also. 54:15 Jonathan was recently doing a bunch of advanced tricks 54:17 to handle the caches for the builds. 54:20 So the way that we handle caches, and we also like tap into uv and how things work 54:25 so that builds can be super, super fast because it's like something is, 54:30 we are, you know, like we are very much targeted at FastAPI and Python in general. 54:36 So we can take advantage of knowing how things run internally, 54:40 how things are installed, how to optimize everything. 54:43 So everything is just like super fast, super fast to install, to run, to like do everything. 54:47 I imagine you all have base Docker images that are like just one layer away 54:54 from whoever's code is running. 54:56 You know, like you've got it all optimized, already pre-built with FastAPI and whatever settings of Python you want. 55:02 A bunch of things and tricks. 55:04 But there are also different things, like the different ways that we do to actually build the things 55:08 and install things and put them inside of the actual build application. 55:14 There's a lot of sourcing that we do there, and Jonathan has been working on a lot of that. 55:21 And there's also all the logic and all the stuff. 55:23 We have a bunch of stuff on top of that to handle out of scaling, 55:27 which is something that is actually not that easy to find in different providers. 55:31 We have auto-scaling based on requests, including scaling down to zero, which saves costs. 55:37 But this is not Lambdas. 55:40 It's not AWS Lambdas. 55:42 It's like the full deployed application, the full container or whatever it is, 55:47 which is the full thing with all the dependencies. 55:50 It's running for whenever it has to run, but we can scale based on requests. 55:54 So I guess it's like the type of thing that you will have if you have this giant cluster for a huge enterprise with a bunch of infra people making sure everything just works perfectly. 56:08 But you just pay us to do that for you. 56:10 This is also a good time for us to probably say lots of stuff is coming and we're in private beta. 56:15 And so you should sign up for the wait list so that you can get admitted and try out these very cool things we've been talking about. 56:22 Absolutely. 56:23 And I think I'll let Tech Insider out in the audience sort of lean into it. 56:29 Public release one. 56:30 Sebastian, when? 56:31 Public release one. 56:32 My final topic, which is just what's the roadmap? 56:35 When is this stuff? 56:36 Like, how do we get into it here? 56:38 Why would they like Litestar? 56:40 We have the, right now we have the waiting list and we are onboarding people. 56:44 We already have like a bunch of people in the private beta. 56:46 We're going to keep onboarding people from the waiting list and like, you know, like ramp that up. 56:51 But it will be like, you know, like through the waiting list is the main place where we are onboarding. 56:56 People will want to make sure that everything is super fine-tuned. 56:58 And we're going to keep it that way for a while. 57:00 So like people that are on the waiting list are going to be like the ones that are going to be able to start using it the soonest. 57:06 At some point, we'll probably have ways for people to invite others and things like that. 57:10 About the things that we are building, we want to, you know, like we are super focused on FastAPI and then Python in general. 57:18 at some point will probably support different tools, 57:21 different ways to run, also like Python code in general, 57:24 probably different frameworks. 57:25 It will also depend a lot on what the users are asking for, 57:30 whether like the tools, the frameworks, the use cases, 57:33 the things that they need to build. 57:34 And like, we're going to evolve the platform and the system 57:38 based on what people need out of it. 57:40 We have like a GitHub repo where we have issues, but we also have like a Slack that once people are admitted, 57:45 they can talk directly to us and that feedback is really, really valuable for shaping the roadmap 57:50 and figuring out all the fun things you want us to support. 57:53 Awesome. Of course, you're going to charge money for it. It runs on servers and you guys are not 57:59 a charity, but can you give any sense of what you're thinking about that kind of stuff or 58:05 join the waitlist and see? 58:06 Well, first join the waitlist and see, but we don't have like that predefined yet, 58:12 but they will be on the ballpark of what you could get from different cloud providers. 58:16 So different similar-ish providers will be on the ballpark of what you will get. 58:24 But it's not written in stone yet. 58:27 It's still a little bit different because we can auto-scale based on requests. 58:32 So we can increase the amount of replicas of your application automatically, 58:36 and then we can decrease them automatically, and we can scale down to zero. 58:40 So you can probably handle all the load that you need and in the end spend a lot less because you don't have to have a bunch of instances constantly running or things like that, you know. 58:50 So it will probably work a little bit different than what it will be for other providers. 58:56 But in the end, it should be roughly similar. 58:58 Okay. And given the fact that you all handle so much of it as a platform as a service type of thing, you don't have to have a cloud expert on hand or a DevOps expert necessarily, right? As soon as a company hires somebody to be an AWS cloud architect or something like that, it's no longer just what is your AWS bill. 59:18 It's also a little bit of pain that we are swallowing so you don't have to take it. 59:22 Exactly. It's part of taking one for the team, right? 59:24 Yes. 59:25 Yes. 59:27 Indeed. 59:27 All right, so I had one or two things specifically that I was seeking. 59:32 It's like custom domains. 59:34 How far off are custom domains? 59:35 I was like, oh, I could put some cool things on there. 59:39 I could tell Jonathan is psyched about this. 59:41 It'd be really fun to put one of my really small FastAPI projects over there, 59:46 something I set up for some of my courses or something, 59:48 and then I can point people to go, look, it's running on FastAPI Cloud. 59:51 How neat, you guys can check that out over there. 59:54 And I'm like, but it's on its own domain, that domain is baked into the course videos, you know what I mean? And it's written in stone. 01:00:00 It's marketing. 01:00:01 Yeah, exactly. So I can't really move it because it has, you know, some subdomain of Talk Python, 01:00:08 right? 01:00:08 I was working on it. And then I got the notification by Google Calendar that I should 01:00:12 join a certain podcast. So... 01:00:14 Are you telling me we don't have custom domains? Because I'm here asking you about custom domains. 01:00:19 How meta is that? 01:00:19 You got it. It could be here already. But no, you have to wait a bit more. 01:00:23 Okay. But soon? 01:00:24 Yeah. As soon as broad enough, but I'm actively working on it. Let's put it like that. 01:00:29 Okay. That sounds great. And then, I mean, just, it's never simple. You know, I just, 01:00:34 I set up some stuff and it's like, you get the pop-up. Oh, you got to put this, you know, 01:00:39 this TXT record or this CNAME or whatever record into your DNS and then we're checking it. Oh, 01:00:45 it might take three days for your DNS to propagate. So hang in there and just, I can imagine like 01:00:50 you're having fun yeah i guess you're kidding me that's like wow i i thought i'm almost off work 01:00:56 but no you're bringing it all back but yeah that's a that's a thing i'm sure the company 01:01:00 could support therapy to like work work through the issues and the trauma that you've suffered 01:01:04 from the dns it's always dns that's right i mean you got that's an yes it's always dns yes 01:01:10 i guess one of our goals with custom domains also to make it super simple for you to set up them 01:01:15 Like, for example, if you're using one of the providers that support OAuth, we can also just do one click and then it's going to be automatically. 01:01:23 Oh, that's cool. Yeah, that's really nice. 01:01:25 But unfortunately, it depends on the platform you're using. 01:01:27 All of them support this. 01:01:29 This is said by the person in charge of most of the integrations. 01:01:32 So Patrick has built, we have integrations for a bunch of database providers and things like that. 01:01:38 I think now Patrick knows by memory, open ID specification. 01:01:42 I don't know. 01:01:44 Yeah, the other thing I wanted to talk a bit about was just integrations, like what kind of stuff you guys have coming in. 01:01:48 I saw that Hugging Face is going to be integrated soon. 01:01:52 You've got Supabase, which is kind of Postgres as a service. 01:01:56 There's a lot of those things out there that theoretically could be added. 01:02:00 Someone also asked for MongoDB. 01:02:01 Maybe that's one that we're going to take a look into. 01:02:04 It really depends on the provider. 01:02:06 So at the moment, we don't want to ask databases for you because that's also another kind of rabbit hole. 01:02:11 Jonathan is probably not ready for that. 01:02:14 But yeah, definitely database. 01:02:16 But I guess we can say that we're also talking with the people from Pydantic 01:02:21 so we can integrate maybe Logfire automatically, that kind of stuff. 01:02:25 Yeah. 01:02:25 And also things like Redis, which is also another kind of database. 01:02:29 That's also coming soon. 01:02:30 Yeah, there's a couple of database as a service type things 01:02:33 that don't require too much other than just connecting API keys 01:02:37 and something like that, right? 01:02:38 Those seem like low-hanging fruit. 01:02:40 Like the kind of goal with the integration is not just done. 01:02:44 Like, yeah, right now it's just setting up an environment variable. 01:02:47 But the idea is also to more, I don't know, like the proper integration, I would say. 01:02:52 Like, for example, for things like Superbase, if, yeah, I think that's support branching. 01:02:56 Like, for example, once we support ProQuest Previews for GitHub, like we can also create 01:03:00 a branch automatically for you if you have the Superbase integration enabled. 01:03:04 And we can do this kind of stuff as well. 01:03:06 Or even we could show like some information about database. 01:03:10 I don't know, like load or like memory usage, things are directly from our dashboard. 01:03:14 So you don't have to go there. 01:03:15 That's the main reason why we're building this infrastructure 01:03:18 for the integration. 01:03:19 Well, people can sign up to the waiting list and hopefully get on the private beta. 01:03:24 We actually check the waiting list. 01:03:26 We actually check the use cases, team sizes, like what are people building with it? 01:03:31 Like we actually go and check it and we bring in people from the waiting list. 01:03:37 Nice. You know, I didn't join the waiting list directly. 01:03:39 I was added by some guy I know who was very kind to help me get some behind-the-scene look. 01:03:45 So I don't know what the process is. 01:03:46 Do you actually say what you want to do with it? 01:03:48 And you evaluate that a little bit as well based on, like, 01:03:51 hey, this would be a cool use case for us to support? 01:03:53 There are many types of applications and many types of different team sizes, 01:03:57 many types of things that people might want to build. 01:04:00 And we try to see, like, okay, where is a case where we could be a good fit and we can provide a great service? 01:04:06 And where are the things that people are trying to build? 01:04:09 Also, it also helps us see, like, you know, like, what are people trying to do with Fasted 01:04:14 Vehicle so that we know what we have to provide? 01:04:17 But we actually go and check those, you know, like those submissions on, like, sexually thousands 01:04:24 of people in the waiting list, but we still go and check and approve kind of manually still 01:04:30 to bring a bunch of people on board in the different ways that we have been bringing people. 01:04:35 So if people go and join the waiting list and actually tell us what they are, what is their 01:04:39 use case, their team, what are they planning on doing? 01:04:42 There's a much higher chance that we are going to go 01:04:45 on to bring them up. 01:04:46 MARK MANDEL: Awesome. 01:04:47 So everyone, go join the waitlist. 01:04:49 If you're doing FastAPI, I'll link to it in the show notes, 01:04:53 of course. 01:04:53 Thank you all for being here and sharing the story. 01:04:57 And I, for one, am very excited to see FastAPI Cloud exist 01:05:01 and just one more way to make FastAPI stronger and more resilient and so on. 01:05:06 FRANCESC CAMPOY: Thank you very much. 01:05:07 Thank you for having us. 01:05:08 Yeah, it's super fun. 01:05:09 Thanks for having us. 01:05:10 Yeah, you bet. 01:05:11 Bye, everyone. 01:05:11 Bye, folks. 01:05:12 Bye-bye. 01:05:12 Bye. 01:05:14 This has been another episode of Talk Python To Me. 01:05:16 Thank you to our sponsors. 01:05:17 Be sure to check out what they're offering. 01:05:19 It really helps support the show. 01:05:21 This episode is brought to you by CommandBook, a native macOS app that I built 01:05:26 that gives long-running terminal commands a permanent home. 01:05:29 No more juggling six terminal tabs every morning. 01:05:31 Carefully craft a command once, run it forever with auto-restart, 01:05:34 Ural detection, and a full CLI. 01:05:36 Download it for free at talkpython.fm/command book app. 01:05:41 And it's brought to you by the Talk Python in Production Book, 01:05:44 an inside look at 10 years of the real-world DevOps behind the Talk Python sites and apps. 01:05:49 Check it out at talkpython.fm/DevOps book. 01:05:52 If you or your team needs to learn Python, we have over 270 hours of beginner and advanced courses on topics ranging from 01:05:59 complete beginners to async code, Flask, Django, HTML, and even LLMs. 01:06:05 Best of all, there's no subscription in sight. 01:06:08 Browse the catalog at talkpython.fm. 01:06:10 And if you're not already subscribed to the show on your favorite podcast player, 01:06:14 what are you waiting for? 01:06:15 Just search for Python in your podcast player. 01:06:17 We should be right at the top. 01:06:18 If you enjoy that geeky rap song, you can download the full track. 01:06:21 The link is actually in your podcast blur show notes. 01:06:24 This is your host, Michael Kennedy. 01:06:26 Thank you so much for listening. 01:06:27 I really appreciate it. 01:06:28 I'll see you next time. 01:06:41 I'm out.

Learn and test the Zen of Python, its guiding aphorisms, and tips for writing clearer, more readable, and maintainable code. In Short: It’s a Humorous Poem Listing Python Philosophies According to the Python glossary , which contains definitions of popular terms related to this programming language, the Zen of Python is a: Listing of Python design principles and philosophies that are helpful in understanding and using the language. The listing can be found by typing “ import this ” at the interactive prompt. ( Source ) Indeed, when you type the indicated import statement into an interactive Python REPL , then you’ll be presented with the nineteen aphorisms that make up the Zen of Python: Python >>> import this The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! The byline reveals the poem’s author, Tim Peters , who’s a renowned software engineer and a long-standing CPython core developer best known for inventing the Timsort sorting algorithm. He also authored the doctest and timeit modules in the Python standard library , along with making many other contributions. Take your time to read through the Zen of Python and contemplate its wisdom. But don’t take the aphorisms literally, as they’re more of a guiding set of principles rather than strict instructions. You’ll learn about their humorous origins in the next section. Remove ads How Did the Zen of Python Originate? The idea of formulating a single document that would encapsulate Python’s fundamental philosophies emerged among the core developers in June 1999. As more and more people began coming to Python from other programming languages, they’d often bring their preconceived notions of software design that weren’t necessarily Pythonic . To help them follow the spirit of the language, a set of recommendations for writing idiomatic Python was needed. The initial discussion about creating such a document took place on the Python mailing list under the subject The Python Way . Today, you can find this conversation in the official Python-list archive . If you look closely at the first message from Tim Peters in that thread, then you’ll notice that he clearly outlined the Zen of Python as a joke. That original form has stuck around until this day: Clearly a job for Guido alone – although I doubt it’s one he’ll take on (fwiw, I wish he would too!). Here’s the outline he would start from, though <wink>: Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than right now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those! There you go: 20 Pythonic Fec^H^H^HTheses on the nose, counting the one I’m leaving for Guido to fill in. If the answer to any Python design issue isn’t obvious after reading those – well, I just give up <wink>. ( Source ) The wink and the playful way of self-censoring some toilet humor are clear giveaways that Tim Peters didn’t want anyone to take his comment too seriously. Note: In case you didn’t get the joke, he started to write something like Feces but then used ^H —which represents a Backspace in older text editors like Vim —to delete the last three letters and make the word Theses . Therefore, the intended phrase is 20 Pythonic Theses . Eventually, these nearly twenty theses got a proper name and were formally codified in a Python Enhancement Proposal document. Each PEP document receives a number. For example, you might have stumbled on PEP 8 , which is the style guide for writing readable Python code. Perhaps as an inside joke, the Zen of Python received the number PEP 20 to signify the incomplete number of aphorisms in it. To win your next argument about what makes good Python code, you can back up your claims with the Zen of Python. If you’d like to refer to a specific aphorism instead of the entire poem, then consider visiting pep20.org , which provides convenient clickable links to each principle. And, in case you want to learn the poem by heart while having some fun, you can now listen to a song with the Zen of Python as its lyrics. Barry Warsaw , another core developer involved with Python since its early days, composed and performed this musical rendition. The song became the closing track on a special vinyl record entitled The Zen Side of the Moon , which was auctioned at PyCon US 2023 . Okay. Now that you have a rough idea of what the Zen of Python is and how it came about, you might be asking yourself whether you should really follow it. Should You Obey the Zen of Python? As a tongue-in-cheek comment left on a mailing list, the Zen of Python should be taken with a grain of salt. That being said, it’s a set of reasonable guidelines that many Python developers abide by. They’d argue that the Zen of Python promotes elegant, readable, and idiomatic code aligned with the philosophy of the language. Ultimately, whether you should follow the Zen of Python and to what extent is up to you because the guidelines are open for interpretation. Simply following them won’t magically make your code look Pythonic or help you make an informed design decision, which may depend on the use case. In contrast, the subjective and often seemingly contradictory advice that the Zen of Python provides can leave you feeling more confused than before. Take the very first principle as an example: Beautiful is better than ugly. What does beautiful or ugly mean exactly? How could you possibly measure how beautiful a given code snippet is? After all, one developer might disagree with another’s interpretation of beauty. These other two principles seem to be at odds with each other: Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. According to the first one, you’re expected to always stick to the rules without breaking them. But immediately after, the following principle suggests that you should consider the practicality of a solution, even if it sometimes means breaking the rules anyway. Therefore, applying the Zen of Python without violating at least some of its principles is virtually impossible. You must choose between the ones to follow and those to bend or ignore. Chris Neugebauer gave a relevant talk about the Zen of Python and its limitations at PyCascades 2023 , which you can watch online . He explores decorators and type hints as two primary examples of Python design decisions that don’t strictly comply with the Zen of Python. Decorators can help you focus on the code’s high-level purpose by hiding uninteresting implementation details at the price of making the code more implicit. This complies with the readability principle but fails to favor explicit code. Type hinting, on the other hand, removes implicit behavior by adding complexity, which goes against the Zen of Python’s emphasis on simplicity. Notice how the same feature can simultaneously follow the Zen of Python and not, depending on which angle you look at it from. In many cases, you’ll need to strike a balance and decide what makes the most sense for your project. In conclusion, while the Zen of Python provides useful guidelines, you shouldn’t strictly adhere to it as a set of rules etched in stone. Instead, you should prioritize practicality and adapt your approach to the problem at hand. Consider other factors such as performance, business requirements, and team conventions when deciding whether to adhere to these opinionated guidelines. Remove ads How Can You Interpret Some of the Aphorisms? The Zen of Python consists of nineteen aphorisms, some of which favor one specific trait over another, providing opinions about what makes your code better : Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. Readability counts. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity. Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. Now is better than never. Although never is often better than *right* now. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those! In this section, you’ll take a closer look at these guidelines, trying to come up with sensible interpretations for them. The first principle in the Zen of Python states that: Beautiful is better than ugly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it’s undeniable that one of the factors behind Python’s popularity, particularly in the data science community, is its approachable and aesthetically pleasing syntax. Consider the following function, which creates a sine wave with the specified amplitude, angular frequency, and phase shift: Python from math import sin def sinusoid ( A , ω , ϕ ): return lambda t : A * sin ( ω * t + ϕ ) This code reads almost like a mathematical formula thanks to Python’s compact syntax, which doesn’t get in your way. The use of Greek letters in variable names, so common in these types of equations, instantly makes the code relatable to anyone familiar with the underlying theory. Finally, the lambda expression makes the code concise while maintaining readability. As you can see, Python’s clarity and expressive power can be hard to beat. The second principle in the Zen of Python says: Explicit is better than implicit. This statement emphasizes the need for your code to be clear and easy to understand rather than relying on unspoken assumptions or hidden rules. For example, when you define a function, it’s much better to explicitly state the expected types of input parameters and the return value instead of forcing whoever reads your code to guess: Python from collections.abc import Callable from math import sin type Amplitude = float type AngularFrequency = float type PhaseShift = float type Time = float type SineWave = Callable [[ Time ], float ] def sinusoid ( A : Amplitude , ω : AngularFrequency , ϕ : PhaseShift ) -> SineWave : """Return a function that computes the sine wave at a given time.""" return lambda t : A * sin ( ω * t + ϕ ) Here, you’ve defined several type aliases with meaningful names and used them as type hints in your function’s parameters to help clarify their purpose and intended use. You’ve also added a docstring explaining what your function returns. Now, anyone looking at your code should have a good idea of what it does and how to use it. Note: In case you haven’t seen type hints in Python before, the colons ( : ) in the code snippet above separate variable names from their corresponding data types. In other words, A: Amplitude means that the parameter A should have type Amplitude , and type Amplitude = float means that Amplitude is a type alias for float . The next two principles from the Zen of Python are: Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. The simplest solutions are often the most elegant and efficient. This truth has been known since the Renaissance, as the famous saying “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” is often attributed to Leonardo da Vinci . Simplicity may not always be possible, though, as some systems are complex by nature, consisting of many moving parts and layers. But that doesn’t mean they have to be complicated or difficult to understand. You can often break a bigger problem down into smaller and more manageable subproblems. Python offers a variety of tools to help you with that, such as list comprehensions , generators , iterators , and more. Another pair of guidelines from the Zen of Python is the following: Flat is better than nested. Sparse is better than dense. When it comes to the structure of your code, it’s generally preferable to keep things flat by avoiding deeply nested structures. In an earlier example, the lambda expression replaced an inner function , which might have looked like this: Python # ... def sinusoid ( A : Amplitude , ω : AngularFrequency , ϕ : PhaseShift ) -> SineWave : """Return a function that computes the sine wave at a given time.""" def wave ( t : Time ) -> float : return A * sin ( ω * t + ϕ ) return wave This code is slightly more explicit and easier to understand, but it’s also nested and verbose. If you had multiple indentation levels nested inside one another, then it could quickly become cluttered and harder to follow. On the other side of the spectrum, you might feel tempted to cram as much code as possible into a single line. This is where the second statement comes in. Instead of using one long line of dense code, it’s usually better to spread the individual instructions out, making them easier to reason about: Python def dense ( A , f , ϕ ): return lambda t : A * sin ( 2 * π * f * t + ϕ ) def sparse ( A , f , ϕ ): ω = 2 * π * f return lambda t : A * sin ( ω * t + ϕ ) In this case, the sparse() function breaks a long formula into smaller parts by extracting the independent terms onto a separate line. While you now have more lines of code to read in the vertical direction, each is shorter and easier to comprehend individually. The final two principles offering qualitative advice are: Now is better than never. Although never is often better than right now. The first one encourages you to take action by trying to implement a working prototype. By the way, Python is an excellent tool for prototyping! You can always keep iterating on your solution without falling into the premature optimization trap, which Donald Knuth famously called “the root of all evil” in computer science. At the same time, you shouldn’t make decisions too hastily, rushing into implementation without giving it at least some thought. Practicing patience can save you from investing your time and effort in something that won’t return the desired results. Your intuition may be wrong, so there’s no point in working on something that you’re not going to need in the first place. As you can tell, mastering the Zen of Python means carefully considering each piece of advice, even when the aphorisms may seem contradictory. While going through each and every line is beyond the scope of this tutorial, the more you work with Python, the more intuitive these proverbs will become. Remove ads What Inside Jokes Does the Zen of Python Hide? While the Zen of Python started as a joke, the humor doesn’t end there. Python is known for having lots of witty references sprinkled throughout the language. After all, its very name is a tribute to the Monty Python comedy group, and the official documentation is full of puns that allude to their numerous sketches. For example, spam is a common placeholder name used instead of the more traditional foobar as an informal nod to the Spam sketch . Fun Fact: The modern meaning of spam as unwanted digital communication also stems from that classic Monty Python sketch, which excessively repeats the word spam . There’s a funny story about the phrase import this , which Barry Warsaw documented on his blog. In a nutshell, the phrase was chosen from hundreds of community submissions for a slogan that could be printed on a T-shirt for a Python conference in 2001. At the very last minute, Barry got the idea to actually implement this.py and sneak it into the next Python release without telling anyone. The module would show the Zen of Python when imported. To make the Zen of Python more difficult to find in Python’s source code , Barry and his small group of accomplices added the module with notifications disabled. They kept it to themselves and even went so far as to obfuscate the code using the ROT-13 substitution cipher to conceal their secret message. It wasn’t until much later that someone finally discovered the hidden module. Note: Displaying the Zen of Python after importing this is just one of many Easter eggs smuggled into Python, but there are several more eggs awaiting discovery.

Share them in the comments below! Ironically, when you look more closely at this.py in the Python source code, then you’ll immediately notice that it violates many of the Zen of Python principles itself: Python s = """Gur Mra bs Clguba, ol Gvz Crgref Ornhgvshy vf orggre guna htyl.

Furthermore, single-letter variable names aren’t explicit , and declaring them in the global scope ignores namespaces altogether. Finally, there’s a simpler way to decode the message using the codecs module instead of manually implementing the algorithm with nested loops that aren’t flat . There’s yet another Easter egg hiding right before your eyes. One of the principles in the Zen of Python is a playful reference to Guido van Rossum , the creator of Python, who’s originally from the Netherlands: Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch. Guido is also known as the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) of Python, enjoying a great deal of respect and having influence over the language and its evolution. In 2018, he officially stepped down from that role, but he remains a key figure in the Python community. The Zen of Python’s author has a great sense of humor. A long time ago, someone opened a ticket in Python’s old bug tracker to point out a punctuation error in another principle. The mistake is in the inconsistent use of the em dashes ( — ) in the following sentence: There should be one– and preferably only one –obvious way to do it. However, that mistake was intentional! The joke, as explained by Tim Peters himself, is that there’s disagreement about whether you should use spaces around em dashes or not: I’m afraid you missed the joke ;-) While you believe spaces are required on both sides of an em dash, there is no consensus on this point. For example, most (but not all) American authorities say /no/ spaces should be used. That’s the joke. In writing a line about “only one way to do it”, I used a device (em dash) for which at least two ways to do it (with spaces, without spaces) are commonly used, neither of which is obvious – and deliberately picked a third way just to rub it in. This will never change ;-) ( Source ) Apart from that, this aphorism directly addresses Perl programmers, whose motto was “ there is more than one way to do it ,” often abbreviated to TIMTOWTDI and pronounced Tim Toady . During the 1990s and early 2000s, Perl and Python were fierce competitors, and their respective communities had a friendly rivalry. The Zen of Python was actually created as a subtle way to poke fun at Perl. So, there you have it. Zen’s twenty principles, only nineteen of which have been written down, are full of clever jokes and references that only a true Pythonista will appreciate. Now you can consider yourself one of them! Conclusion In this tutorial, you’ve explored the Zen of Python, a humorous poem listing opinionated Python philosophies authored by Tim Peters. Along the way, you’ve learned how it originated, what some of its aphorisms mean, and whether you should follow them. You’ve also uncovered several inside jokes and references hidden in the Zen of Python, which is now an important part of Python’s culture.

These FAQs are related to the most important concepts you’ve covered in this tutorial. Click the Show/Hide toggle beside each question to reveal the answer. What is the Zen of Python? Show/Hide The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 aphorisms that capture the guiding principles behind Python’s design philosophy. Tim Peters wrote them in 1999, and they were later formalized as PEP 20. How do I display the Zen of Python? Show/Hide Type import this in a Python interpreter or REPL. This imports a hidden module that prints all 19 aphorisms to the screen. Who wrote the Zen of Python? Show/Hide Tim Peters, a renowned software engineer and long-standing CPython core developer, wrote the Zen of Python in 1999. He’s also known for inventing the Timsort sorting algorithm. How many aphorisms are in the Zen of Python? Show/Hide There are 19 written aphorisms, though PEP 20 was intentionally numbered to suggest 20 principles with one left for Guido van Rossum to fill in. That twentieth aphorism was never written. Should I follow the Zen of Python strictly? Show/Hide No. The aphorisms are guidelines, not strict rules. Some of them intentionally contradict each other, so you’ll need to use your judgment and prioritize practicality based on your specific situation.

Title: Django Steering Council 2025 Year in Review

Django Steering Council 2025 Year in Review | Weblog | Django Skip to main content Django The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. Menu Main navigation Overview Download Documentation News Code Issues Community Foundation ♥ Donate Search Submit Toggle theme (current theme: auto) Toggle theme (current theme: light) Toggle theme (current theme: dark) Toggle Light / Dark / Auto color theme News & Events Django Steering Council 2025 Year in Review Posted by Frank Wiles on Feb. 11, 2026 The members of the Steering Council wanted to provide you all with a quick TL;DR of our work in 2025. First off, we were elected at the end of 2024 and got started in earnest in early 2025 with the mission to revive and dramatically increase the role of the Steering Council. We're meeting for a video conference at least monthly, you can deep dive into the meeting notes to see what we've been up to. We also have set up Slack channels we use to communicate in between meetings to keep action items moving along. One of the first things we did was temporarily suspend much of the process around DEP 10 . Its heart is in the right place, but it's just too complex and cumbersome day-to-day with a primarily volunteer organization. We're slowly making progress on a revamped and simplified process that addresses our concerns. It is our goal to finish this before our terms expire. New Features Process We've moved the process for proposing new features out of the Django Forum and mailing lists to new-features Github repository . We made this change for a variety of reasons, but the largest being to reduce the workload for the Django Fellows in shepherding the process and answering related questions. Community Ecosystem Page One of our main goals is to increase the visibility of the amazing Django third-party package ecosystem. Long time Django users know which packages to use, which you can trust, and which ones may be perfect for certain use cases. However, MANY newer or more casual Django users are often unaware of these great tools and not sure where to even begin. As a first step, we've added the Community Ecosystem page which highlights several amazing resources to keep in touch with what is going on with Django, how to find recommended packages, and a sample list of those packages the Steering Council itself recommends and uses frequently. Administrative bits There has been work on better formalizing and documenting our processes and building documentation to make it much easier for the next Steering Council members. There has also been fair bit of work around helping organize Google Summer of Code participants to help ensure the projects undertaken are ones that will ultimately be accepted smoothly into Django. Another area we have focused on is a simplified DEP process. We're still formalizing this, but the idea is to have the Steering Council do the majority of the heavy lifting on writing these and in a format that is shorter/simpler to reduce the friction of creating larger more complicated DEPs. We have also been in discussions with various third parties about acquiring funding for some of the new features and updates on the horizon. It's been a productive year and we're aiming to have 2026 be as productive if not more so. We're still setting all of our 2026 goals and will report on those soon.

2025, year in review Skip to content. Home logo Main navigation blog til About Toggle theme (current theme: auto) Toggle theme (current theme: light) Toggle theme (current theme: dark) Toggle Light / Dark / Auto color theme 2025, year in review February 12, 2026 - #reflexion Hi there, it has been a while as usual! Happy new year dear reader! I hope the best for you. My end of the 2025 year has been really tricky for me so I'm definitely late writing this post but it's never too late for anything right? It's always when you write this kind of post that you realized how much you have accomplished, especially on things you weren't expecting to do, so many things on this field. And all the things you didn't managed to do but, new year, new possibilities! So here we go, Sarah's year in review! ✨ TL;DR This year was awesome, I success to do things and I wouldn't have expected to do, and I am very grateful for all the support I had this year, all the amazing friends I have, all the opportunities I had. This year was also a year of learning and growth for me. Huge personal challenges that has pushed me to change, improve and be more confident in myself. Still a lot of work to do but I feel I'm on the right path. My highlights for the year have been: Be Vice President of the Django Software Foundation (DSF) Meet the community all over the world Organized a devroom in FOSDEM Keynoting in few conferences First full solo travel trip See remote friends in real life retake drawing and creative skills Volunteering and community I attended and spoke at several conferences this year, which was a great experience for me. I did that not only to share my knowledge, promote Django and the DSF but also to see the community everywhere in the world. As a DSF representative, it was important for me to be present and accessible in the community. It was also a good way to connect with people locally and get their feedback on how the DSF can better support them and things we could improve. I have attended and/or spoken at: PyCon IT FOSDEM DjangoCon Europe DjangoCon Africa DjangoCongress JP (online) PyCon Africa (online) PyCon FR DjangoDay India PyLadiesCon (online) Some others conferences I would have liked to attend but couldn't make it this year due to time or budget constraints but I was involved in some ways like EuroPython where I helped to get a community booth. I gave my first keynote at PyCon IT, which was a huge milestone for me. My keynoter badge for PyCon IT with some stickers It was scary but also very rewarding. Thank you so much the organizing team for trusting me with this opportunity! My keynote was on raising awareness on accessibility . Related to accessibility, with some friends we organized the first Inclusive Web Devroom . FOSDEM is a huge event in Europe and it was a great opportunity to bring more visibility to this important topic. Still involved in my favorite community space, Djangonaut Space , where I helped as much as I can, and I switched to an advisor role this year due to my other commitments. And one of my commitments was being Vice President of the DSF, which was a huge honor for me. I tried my best to represent the community and help the DSF to achieve its mission. It's always hard to do all the things you have planned, especially as a volunteer, but I think we made some good progress this year. I'm taking this opportunity to thank all the amazing people in the DSF board and all the volunteers who are doing an amazing job to support the community and the project. Specially, I want to thank the former DSF president, Thibaud Colas, who has been an excellent leader and teammate 💚 I hope to be able to continue to grow, improve and welcome people to the Django community and met other friends from all over the world. I will do my best to continue the DSF Member of the Month initiative, which is a great way to highlight the great people in our community and their contributions. I'm sure there will be more to come in 2026! Creative and personal projects This year I realized I completely abandoned all the creative work I used to do, and I'm trying to get back into it because it's something I really enjoy and I'm a fairly creative person in general. I retook drawing and painting, I really enjoy it, it's a good way for me to relax and express myself. I also want to try other creative things like photography, but I need to change my camera first, so if you have any recommendation, let me know! I'm also trying to do some self-work, I think it's important to take care of yourself and work on your personal growth. I have been reading some books on this topic and it's really helpful for me. I want to keep doing this work and improve myself in many areas, I think it's important to be a better version of yourself to be able to help others too. I hope to share some of my learnings and insights on this topic in the future, maybe in a blog post or something like that. I'm also trying to learn new things, I have a long list of things I want to learn but I need to prioritize them. Some of the things I want to learn in 2026 are: Improve my drawing skills Learn more about web accessibility Learn more about self-care and personal growth Travel and experiences This year I had the chance to travel a lot for conferences and personal trips. I love so much to travel and discover new places, cultures, and meet new people. It's always a great way for me to meet friends in real life too. I have been to: Belgium France Greece Germany Ireland Italy India Netherlands Poland Tanzania United Kingdom United States of America Some of those trips were for conferences, some were for work or for personal reasons, but all of them were great experiences for me. I realized I have been to almost all the continents this year, which is something I didn't expect to do when I started the year. I also had the chance to do my first full solo travel trip, which was such an achievement for me! I went first in Berlin in Germany completely alone, which was a bit scary but also very rewarding. Funily, I choose to go when there was a festival of lights I didn't know about, so I had the chance to see the city in a different way and it was really beautiful. Brandenburg Gate with blue lights for the Festival of lights in Berlin Then I went to India for DjangoDay India, which was also a lovely experience. I had the chance to meet many people from the community and discover the country. I stayed more days to visit other cities, from the north to the south, and it was really amazing. Bengaluru palace in India I really want to go back to India, there is so much to see and discover there. It's a country where you either love it or hate it, but for me, it's a place that has a lot of charm and I really enjoy it. Outside of Asia, I want to do more trips in Africa in the future. I discover Tanzania for the first time this year with DjangoCon Africa and it was amazing. I have written a blog post about my experience at the conference . I really enjoyed the culture, the people, and the nature there. There are so many beautiful places to see and I want to discover more of them. Europe is also a great place to travel, there are so many beautiful cities and countries to discover. Some pictures of my trips in Europe: Warsaw in December with Christmas lights, Poland Road in the center of Bologna, Italy I have been to Americas too, but more in the north to visit family, I want to discover more of the south in the future. The Capitol in Washington DC, USA I also experienced some things that I didn't expect to experience, like the breakup of my very long relationship, which was a really hard experience but I think it was also a good opportunity for me to grow and learn more about myself. One thing I learned from all those travels and experiences is that it's important to be open to new things and take time to take care of yourself, especially when you are in a new place or going through a hard time. Lessons and insights I've learned a lot during the 2025's year, by trying things, going out of my comfort zone and making mistakes, of course. I tried to be more close to what I really want which means improving myself in many topics. I improved my public speaking skills by giving talks in conferences. I improved my leadership skills by being Vice President of the DSF and other volunteering roles. I still have work to do but I'm proud of the progress I made. I keep working on my communication skills, especially in English, and I feel a bit more comfortable now. I learned to think more about myself and my needs, still a work in progress but there are improvements. I also learned a lot by meeting people and chatting with them, I have the chance to meet many amazing people this year and I'm really grateful for that. I know that I'm really good at connecting people to each other, which is something I really enjoy and I want to keep doing it. I also learned that it's important to take care of yourself and work on your personal growth, I think it's important to be a better version of yourself to be able to help others too. My favorite quote for this year was "Feel the fear and do it anyway" by Susan Jeffers, which is a great reminder for me to keep trying new things and not be afraid of failure. My quote for 2026 is "Try more things, take more risks, embrace more discomfort" by Peter McKenzie, which is a reminder for me to keep improving myself in many areas and be ok with the fact of not being comfortable. Reminder to myself 2025 I keep trying things I wasn't comfortable with. 2026, Tim Schilling recently asked me what would be my theme for this year, I think it would be "letting go and self-love" as I want to keep improving myself in many areas. It's a long road but I'm confident. It will not be easy but I'm not alone and it can just help me to be a better version of myself and be able to help others too. Piece of advice to tell for this new year: Keep trying, making mistakes is not that bad Practice is important to be good at something Be kind to yourself Letting go of what doesn't serve you anymore Focus on what matters to you Celebrate your progress, no matter how small Take time for self-care and reflection Embrace change and be open to new opportunities Do what makes you happy and fulfilled, and don't be afraid to change your path if it doesn't feel right anymore. I hope this year will be a good one for you, and I wish you all the best for 2026!
