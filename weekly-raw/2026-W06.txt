Are you a Novice, Intermediate, Proficient, or Expert? How Long Does It Take to Learn Python Basics? Python is beginner-friendly, and you can start writing simple programs in just a few days. But reaching the basics stage still takes consistent practice because you’re learning both the language itself and how to think like a programmer. The following timeline shows how long it typically takes to learn Python basics based on how much time you can practice each week: Weekly practice time Typical timeline for basics What that feels like 2–3 hours/week 8–12 months Slow but steady progress 5–10 hours/week 3–6 months Realistic pace for busy adults 15–20 hours/week ~2 months Consistent focus and fast feedback 40+ hours/week ~1 month Full-time immersion These ranges assume about five study days per week . If you add a sixth day, you’ll likely land toward the faster end of each range. You’ll get better results if you use this table as a planning guide. Don’t think of it as rigid deadlines—your learning pace depends on many factors . For example, if you already know another programming language, then you can usually move faster. If you’re brand-new to coding, then expect to be at the slower end of each range. As a general guideline, many beginners reach the basics in about 2 to 6 months with steady practice. Note: If you’re ready to fast-track your learning with an expert-guided small cohort course that gives you live guidance and accountability, then check out Real Python’s live courses ! With a focused schedule of around four hours per day, five days per week, you can often reach the basics stage in roughly 6 to 10 weeks, assuming you’re writing and debugging code most sessions. By then, you should be able to finish several small projects on your own. When you read online that someone learned Python quickly, they’re probably talking about this basics stage. And indeed, with the right mix of dedication, circumstances, and practice, learning Python basics can happen pretty fast! Before you go ahead and lock in a timeline, take a moment to clarify for yourself why you want to learn Python. Understanding your motivation for learning Python will help along the way. What Does "Learning Python" Even Mean? Show/Hide Learning Python means more than just learning the Python programming language. You need to know more than just the specifics of a single programming language to do something useful with your programming skills . At the same time, you don’t need to understand every single aspect of Python to be productive. Learning Python is about learning how to accomplish practical tasks with Python programming. It’s about having a skill set that you can use to build projects for yourself or an employer. As your next step, write down your personal goal for learning Python. Always keep that goal in mind throughout your learning journey. Your goal shapes what you need to learn and how quickly you’ll progress. Remove ads What’s a Practical 30-Day Learning Plan for Complete Beginners? When you’re clear about your why , you can start drafting your personal Python learning roadmap . If you’re starting from zero and can spend about 5 to 10 hours per week, the following plan keeps you moving without becoming overwhelming: Week 1 : Install and set up Python, learn about basic syntax , variables , and conditional statements Week 2 : Learn about basic data types , for and while loops , and functions Week 3 : Work with lists and dictionaries , file I/O , and debugging basics Week 4 : Build a small project , add simple tests , and polish it through refactoring Aim to finish at least one small project by the end of the month. The project matters more than completing every tutorial or task on your checklist. For a guided learning path that starts from the beginning and leads you to a fundamental understanding of object-oriented programming, you can follow the Python Basics Learning Path: Learning Path Python Basics: Introduction to Python 17 Resources ⋅ Skills: Python 3 Fundamentals, Real-World Projects This plan can get you started, but you’ll need to continue to reach a basic proficiency. How Many Hours Does It Take to Learn Python? How much time you can spend learning has a huge impact on your outcomes. Therefore, the total number of hours spent actively learning is a better planning unit than calendar months or weeks. As a rough guide, you can expect the following time commitment in hours : Level Description Estimated Focused Hours Basic comfort Syntax and small scripts 150–200 Solid ability Small projects and tools 300–500 Job-ready for a junior role Portfolio projects, real dev tools 600–1,200 For these timelines to work, you need to spend the hours actively writing, running, and debugging code. Passively watching videos or reading tutorials won’t be enough! Note: For many learners, a live course helps to fast-track learning through expert guidance and built-in accountability. You need to focus your attention and put in the practice for your brain to properly internalize programming concepts. How Long Does It Take to Become Job-Ready With Python? Job-ready doesn’t mean you need to be a Python expert. It means that you can build and explain real projects, use common development tools, and keep learning on the job. At a minimum, you should be able to: Understand Python basics , including object-oriented programming Build and explain two to four portfolio projects of your own Use modules and packages and understand how to evaluate third-party packages Work with virtual environments , optionally using uv , and understand dependency management Use Git and work with a local development setup Read docs and debug errors independently Write tests and handle exceptions Work with at least one library or framework tied to your target role Have a high-level understanding of coding with AI and some experience using an agentic coding tool such as Claude Code Complete beginners often need 6 to 12 months to reach this level. There’s a lot to learn! If you already code in another language, 2 to 6 months can be enough with a focused plan. As mentioned earlier, the actual hours you put in matter most, so if you only have a few hours per week, expect to be at the longer end of the range. Remove ads How Do Timelines Differ by Goal? Your learning timeline will change depending on what you want to accomplish. Here are some realistic ranges for common goals: Automation for work tasks : If your goal is to automate spreadsheets, rename files, or scrape data, you can often get useful results in 1 to 2 months. Add another month or two for reliable, reusable scripts. Web development ( FastAPI , Flask , or Django ) : Expect 2 to 4 months after the basics to build and deploy a small web app. Job-ready web skills usually take 6 to 12 months because you also need databases , deployment , and testing. Data analysis : If you already know Python basics , plan on 2 to 6 months to get comfortable with pandas , visualization , and SQL . Data science and machine learning : Plan on 9 to 18 months on top of your Python skills if you’re starting from scratch in this field. You can get productive sooner if you already have a solid math background . Always keep your motivation and reason for learning Python in mind. As mentioned before, it’ll shape both your journey and your timeline. What Factors Influence Your Learning Speed? Now that you have an idea of typical timelines, it’s worth remembering that learning is a personal process. Multiple factors determine how much time and effort learning Python will take for you . Here are some individual factors to consider: Motivation: What do you want to use Python for, and how urgently do you want to learn it? If you have a clearly defined aim, such as a specific challenge you want to tackle, then it’ll be more straightforward to stay focused and motivated, and you might progress more quickly. Availability: How much time can you invest in learning Python? Are you a student or between jobs? Can you dedicate a significant amount of each day to studying programming? Do you have a full-time job, meaning you can only study outside of work? Do you take care of children or other people? The more time you have to invest, the faster you’ll progress. Background: What previous experience do you have? If you know English well, have programmed in another language, or have experience with mathematical logic and language learning , then you might progress more quickly. Mentorship: Do you have someone who can teach you? You’ll learn faster with a knowledgeable friend or mentor who’s been through the process themselves and is ready to share their knowledge with you. You can get support from a colleague, a dedicated mentor, or online. If you don’t have a mentor in mind, get involved in a learning community or switch your favorite AI tool into learning mode . Aim: What skill level are you aiming for, and what goal do you hope to achieve by learning Python? If you’re planning to get a full-time position as a Python developer, you’ll need to dive deeper into more aspects of the language than if you’re planning to complete a hobby project. Learning Resources: Do you have access to quality learning resources ? They can help you decide what to learn first and how to continue. If your learning resources have high instructional quality as well as accuracy, then you’ll learn the right things more quickly. These are the most important factors, and they combine uniquely to shape your pace as you progress. To give you a quick reference of how each element might affect your journey, consult the following summary table that highlights the main factors and their typical impact on learning speed (⚡️): Factor Description Influence Motivation Clear personal reasons, goals, and urgency help you stay focused and support consistent learning. ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ Availability Available study time and outside responsibilities shape how quickly you can make progress. ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ Background Prior experience with coding, English proficiency, and logic, math, or language learning lead to a faster start. ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Mentorship A mentor or learning community helps you overcome confusion and setbacks faster and provides accountability. ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Aim Career ambitions and long-term goals will require more effort and depth than a single hobby project. ⚡⚡⚡ Learning Resources High-quality, well-structured learning materials accelerate progress and save you time by avoiding weak or confusing sources. ⚡⚡⚡ You can use this table to quickly identify which factors currently work in your favor and which areas might be worth improving or seeking support for. Note: A professional live cohort course takes care of motivation , availability , mentorship and learning resources all at once to help you learn faster. There may be other factors that’ll influence your personal learning journey. If you’re clear on the factors most relevant for your situation, you’re in a better position to accurately assess the time you’ll need. What Are Common Pitfalls That Slow You Down? The biggest slowdowns usually come from habits. Many people get stuck after starting strong and drift into busywork or endless preparation. If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone, and the fix is usually a change in how you practice and choose projects. Here are the common patterns that can show up. If you catch yourself in one, focus on improving just that habit this week: Tutorial-hopping without finishing : You get a quick hit of progress, but you never build the confidence that comes from shipping something real. Projects that are too big : Large scope turns into endless planning and pushes the first working version further away. Consuming content without coding : Reading and watching feel productive, but learning sticks when you write, run, and debug code. Avoiding error messages : Errors are helpful feedback. They don’t mean that you failed. If you skip understanding and dealing with errors, then you skip a fast track to learning. Focus on consistent, hands-on coding, break projects into achievable pieces, and actively seek out feedback or community support . If you become intentional about how you learn and practice to avoid these common pitfalls, then you can make steady, rewarding progress. How to Learn Python Faster Once you know why you want to learn Python, what skill level you’re aiming for, and how to factor in your personal background, you can make your learning process more effective. The fastest progress comes from deliberate practice, tight feedback loops, and the right kind of support . Remove ads Use Deliberate Practice and Feedback Loops You’ll learn Python faster if most of your learning sessions end with working code and a clear takeaway. That means you’ll have to type and run code as you go instead of just reading or watching. It also means building short feedback loops , where you write a few lines of code, run them, inspect and understand the output—which can be an error message—and adjust. This may feel slow at first, but it’s what makes learning stick. If you want a practical rhythm, try this checklist for each study session: Code: Write and run code every few minutes, not only at the end. Debug: Use the REPL and a debugger to inspect values and trace errors. Focus: Build small, shippable projects with clear goals and tight scope. Test: Add a small test for the core logic of your project so you can refactor with confidence. Log: Keep a short note about what you learned after each study session. These suggestions might not make a great acronym (CDFTL?), but they help you build good habits that anchor what you’re learning. With consistent effort and the right approach, you’ll pick up Python faster and retain what you learn. Use AI Tools and LLMs Wisely AI can speed up your learning when you treat it as a coach . It’s great for explanations, seeing alternate approaches, and small examples that you can compare to your own code. It’s also great at debugging when you show a minimal, self-written snippet and ask for feedback. Using AI for learning Python can become problematic if you copy generated code without understanding it. The problem isn’t necessarily that the code won’t work, but that you’re skipping the mental work that’s necessary for your mind to actually learn . If you want to keep the benefits without the downsides, then use AI in ways that still keep you in the driver’s seat: Ask for explanations and alternatives instead of just asking for answers. Verify results by running code and checking official documentation, and add tests when possible. Use AI to generate practice variations instead of complete, finished projects. Summarize what you learned after each session in a short note so it sticks. If you keep these suggestions in mind, you can use AI tools to speed up your Python learning without skipping fundamental understanding. It’ll pay off in the long run! Aside from impacts on your learning, also keep in mind that AI output can be wrong or incomplete. Always treat generated code as a draft and double-check its accuracy so that you’re not accidentally leaking sensitive information or creating brittle and unsafe software.

Title: Zsh: select generated files with (om[1]) glob qualifiers
Date: 27-01-2026

Zsh: select generated files with (om[1]) glob qualifiers - Adam Johnson Adam Johnson Home | Blog | Books | Projects | Consulting | Contact | Colophon Zsh: select generated files with (om[1]) glob qualifiers 2026-01-27 Iâve recently been using memray , a memory profiler for Python, to optimize the startup memory usage (and time) for a client. Itâs a fantastic tool, but its flexibility hampers getting instant feedback. It takes three commands to profile a program, generate a flame graph from the profile, and open the flame graph in the browser: $ memray run manage.py check Writing profile results into memray-manage.py.60450.bin System check identified no issues (17 silenced). [memray] Successfully generated profile results. You can now generate reports from the stored allocation records. Some example commands to generate reports: /.../python -m memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.60450.bin $ memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.60450.bin Wrote memray-flamegraph-manage.py.60450.html $ open -a Firefox memray-flamegraph-manage.py.60450.html Notice that commands 1 and 2 generate files whose names need copying to the next one. While the names are predictable, they include the process ID, which changes each time you run the process, making scripting awkward. In Zsh, we can avoid copying such generated filenames by using glob qualifiers , which are extra syntax you can add to filename globs in Zsh. Specifically, we want to attach the glob qualifiers om[1] , which mean: o : sort the matches m : by modification time, most recent first [1] : select only the first match Attaching these qualifiers to appropriate globs allows commands to pick up a generated file without knowing its exact name. For example, step 2 can be written: $ memray flamegraph memray-*.bin ( om [ 1 ]) Thus, the whole process can be turned into a one-liner: $ memray run manage.py check && memray flamegraph memray-*.bin ( om [ 1 ]) && open -a Firefox memray-flamegraph-*.html ( om [ 1 ]) Boom!

Title: Django: profile memory usage with Memray
Date: 29-01-2026
URL: https://adamj.eu/tech/2026/01/29/django-profile-memray/

--- FULL CONTENT ---
Django: profile memory usage with Memray - Adam Johnson Adam Johnson Home | Blog | Books | Projects | Consulting | Contact | Colophon Django: profile memory usage with Memray 2026-01-29 Memory usage can be hard to keep under control in Python projects. The language doesnât make it explicit where memory is allocated, module imports can have signficant costs, and itâs all too easy to create a global data structure that accidentally grows unbounded, leaking memory. Django projects can be particularly susceptible to memory bloat, as they may import many large dependencies like numpy , even if theyâre only used in a few places. One tool to help understand your programâs memory usage is Memray , a memory profiler for Python created by developers at Bloomberg. Memray tracks where memory is allocated and deallocated during program execution. It can then present that data in various ways, including spectucular flame graphs , collapsing many stack traces into a chart where bar width represents memory allocation size. Profile a Django project Memray can profile any Python command with its memray run command. For a Django project, I suggest you start by profiling the check management command, which loads your project and then runs system checks. This is a good approximation of the minimum work required to start up your Django app, imposed on every server load and management command execution. To profile check , run: $ memray run manage.py check Writing profile results into memray-manage.py.4579.bin System check identified no issues (0 silenced). [memray] Successfully generated profile results. You can now generate reports from the stored allocation records. Some example commands to generate reports: /.../.venv/bin/python3 -m memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.4579.bin The command completes as normal, outputting System check identified no issues (0 silenced). . Around that, Memray outputs information about its profiling, saved in a .bin file featuring the process ID, and a suggestion to follow up by generating a flame graph. The flame graph is great, so go ahead and make it: $ memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.4579.bin Wrote memray-flamegraph-manage.py.4579.html The result is a .html file you can open in your browser, which will look something like this: The header of the page contains some controls, along with a mini graph tracking resident and heap memory over time. Underneath it is the main flame graph, showing memory allocations over time. By default, the graph is actually an âicicleâ graph, with frames stacked downward like icicles, rather than upward like flames. This matches Pythonâs stack trace representation, where the most recent call is at the bottom. Toggle between flame and icicle views with the buttons in the header. The Stats button at the top opens a dialog with several details, including the peak memory usage: Frames in the graph display the line of code running at the time, and their width is proportional to the amount of memory allocated at that point. Hover a frame to reveal its details: filename, line number, memory allocated, and number of allocations: Make an improvement In the above example, I already narrowed in on a potential issue. The line from numpy.random import ... allocates 5.7 MB of memory, about 23% of the peak usage of 25.2 MB. This import occurs in example/utils.py , on line 3. Letâs look at that code now: from colorsys import hls_to_rgb from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: """ Generate a list of distinct colours for the given number of icons. """ colours = [] for i in range ( number ): hue = i / number lightness = 0.5 saturation = 0.7 rgb = hls_to_rgb ( hue , lightness , saturation ) hex_colour = "#" + "" . join ( f " { int ( c * 255 ) : 02x } " for c in rgb ) colours . append ( hex_colour ) Generator ( MT19937 ( 42 )) . shuffle ( colours ) return colours The code uses the Generator.shuffle() method from numpy.random to shuffle a list of generated colours. Since importing numpy is costly, and this colour generation is only used in a few code paths (imagine weâd checked), we have a few options: Delete the codeâthis is always an option if the function isnât used or can be replaced with something simpler, like pregenerated lists of colours. Defer the import until needed, by moving it within the function: def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: """ Generate a list of distinct colours for the given number of icons. """ from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator ... Doing so will avoid the import cost until the first time the function is called, or something else imports numpy.random . Use a lazy import: lazy from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... This syntax should become available from Python 3.15 (expected October 2026), following the implementation of PEP 810 . It makes a given imported module or name only get imported on first usage. Until itâs out, an alternative is available in wrapt.lazy_import() , which creates an import-on-use module proxy: from wrapt import lazy_import npr = lazy_import ( "numpy.random" ) def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... npr . Generator ( npr . MT19937 ( 42 )) . shuffle ( colours ) ... Use a lighter-weight alternative, for example Pythonâs built-in random.shuffle() function: import random ... def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... random . shuffle ( colours ) ... In this case, I would go with option 4, as it avoids the heavy numpy dependency altogether, will provide almost equivalent results, and doesnât need any negotiation about changing functionality. We will see an improvement in startup memory usage as long as no other startup code path also imports numpy.random . After making an edit, re-profile and look for changes: In this case, it seems the change worked and memory usage has reduced. The flame graph looks like the right ~75% of the previous one, with âiciclesâ for regular parts of Djangoâs startup process, such as importing django.db.models and running configure_logging() . And the Stats dialog shows a lower peak value. A drop from 25.2 MB to 19.4 MB, or 22% overall reduction! (If the change hadnât worked, we would probably have revealed another module that is loaded at startup and imports numpy.random . Removing or deferring that import could then yield the saving.) A Zsh one-liner to speed up checking results If you use Zsh, you chain memray run , memray flamegraph , and opening the HTML result file with: $ memray run manage.py check && memray flamegraph memray-*.bin ( om [ 1 ]) && open -a Firefox memray-flamegraph-*.html ( om [ 1 ]) This can really speed up doing multiple iterations measuring potential improvements. I covered the (om[1]) globbing syntax in this previous Zsh-specific post .
