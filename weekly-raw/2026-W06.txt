Title: Django: profile memory usage with Memray
Date: 29-01-2026
URL: https://adamj.eu/tech/2026/01/29/django-profile-memray/

--- FULL CONTENT ---
Django: profile memory usage with Memray - Adam Johnson Adam Johnson Home | Blog | Books | Projects | Consulting | Contact | Colophon Django: profile memory usage with Memray 2026-01-29 Memory usage can be hard to keep under control in Python projects. The language doesnât make it explicit where memory is allocated, module imports can have signficant costs, and itâs all too easy to create a global data structure that accidentally grows unbounded, leaking memory. Django projects can be particularly susceptible to memory bloat, as they may import many large dependencies like numpy , even if theyâre only used in a few places. One tool to help understand your programâs memory usage is Memray , a memory profiler for Python created by developers at Bloomberg. Memray tracks where memory is allocated and deallocated during program execution. It can then present that data in various ways, including spectucular flame graphs , collapsing many stack traces into a chart where bar width represents memory allocation size. Profile a Django project Memray can profile any Python command with its memray run command. For a Django project, I suggest you start by profiling the check management command, which loads your project and then runs system checks. This is a good approximation of the minimum work required to start up your Django app, imposed on every server load and management command execution. To profile check , run: $ memray run manage.py check Writing profile results into memray-manage.py.4579.bin System check identified no issues (0 silenced). [memray] Successfully generated profile results. You can now generate reports from the stored allocation records. Some example commands to generate reports: /.../.venv/bin/python3 -m memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.4579.bin The command completes as normal, outputting System check identified no issues (0 silenced). . Around that, Memray outputs information about its profiling, saved in a .bin file featuring the process ID, and a suggestion to follow up by generating a flame graph. The flame graph is great, so go ahead and make it: $ memray flamegraph memray-manage.py.4579.bin Wrote memray-flamegraph-manage.py.4579.html The result is a .html file you can open in your browser, which will look something like this: The header of the page contains some controls, along with a mini graph tracking resident and heap memory over time. Underneath it is the main flame graph, showing memory allocations over time. By default, the graph is actually an âicicleâ graph, with frames stacked downward like icicles, rather than upward like flames. This matches Pythonâs stack trace representation, where the most recent call is at the bottom. Toggle between flame and icicle views with the buttons in the header. The Stats button at the top opens a dialog with several details, including the peak memory usage: Frames in the graph display the line of code running at the time, and their width is proportional to the amount of memory allocated at that point. Hover a frame to reveal its details: filename, line number, memory allocated, and number of allocations: Make an improvement In the above example, I already narrowed in on a potential issue. The line from numpy.random import ... allocates 5.7 MB of memory, about 23% of the peak usage of 25.2 MB. This import occurs in example/utils.py , on line 3. Letâs look at that code now: from colorsys import hls_to_rgb from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: """ Generate a list of distinct colours for the given number of icons. """ colours = [] for i in range ( number ): hue = i / number lightness = 0.5 saturation = 0.7 rgb = hls_to_rgb ( hue , lightness , saturation ) hex_colour = "#" + "" . join ( f " { int ( c * 255 ) : 02x } " for c in rgb ) colours . append ( hex_colour ) Generator ( MT19937 ( 42 )) . shuffle ( colours ) return colours The code uses the Generator.shuffle() method from numpy.random to shuffle a list of generated colours. Since importing numpy is costly, and this colour generation is only used in a few code paths (imagine weâd checked), we have a few options: Delete the codeâthis is always an option if the function isnât used or can be replaced with something simpler, like pregenerated lists of colours. Defer the import until needed, by moving it within the function: def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: """ Generate a list of distinct colours for the given number of icons. """ from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator ... Doing so will avoid the import cost until the first time the function is called, or something else imports numpy.random . Use a lazy import: lazy from numpy.random import MT19937 , Generator def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... This syntax should become available from Python 3.15 (expected October 2026), following the implementation of PEP 810 . It makes a given imported module or name only get imported on first usage. Until itâs out, an alternative is available in wrapt.lazy_import() , which creates an import-on-use module proxy: from wrapt import lazy_import npr = lazy_import ( "numpy.random" ) def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... npr . Generator ( npr . MT19937 ( 42 )) . shuffle ( colours ) ... Use a lighter-weight alternative, for example Pythonâs built-in random.shuffle() function: import random ... def generate_icon_colours ( number : int ) -> list [ str ]: ... random . shuffle ( colours ) ... In this case, I would go with option 4, as it avoids the heavy numpy dependency altogether, will provide almost equivalent results, and doesnât need any negotiation about changing functionality. We will see an improvement in startup memory usage as long as no other startup code path also imports numpy.random . After making an edit, re-profile and look for changes: In this case, it seems the change worked and memory usage has reduced. The flame graph looks like the right ~75% of the previous one, with âiciclesâ for regular parts of Djangoâs startup process, such as importing django.db.models and running configure_logging() . And the Stats dialog shows a lower peak value. A drop from 25.2 MB to 19.4 MB, or 22% overall reduction! (If the change hadnât worked, we would probably have revealed another module that is loaded at startup and imports numpy.random . Removing or deferring that import could then yield the saving.) A Zsh one-liner to speed up checking results If you use Zsh, you chain memray run , memray flamegraph , and opening the HTML result file with: $ memray run manage.py check && memray flamegraph memray-*.bin ( om [ 1 ]) && open -a Firefox memray-flamegraph-*.html ( om [ 1 ]) This can really speed up doing multiple iterations measuring potential improvements. I covered the (om[1]) globbing syntax in this previous Zsh-specific post .

Instead of clicking through menus, you type commands to navigate folders, run scripts, install packages, and manage version control. This command-line approach is faster and more flexible than graphical interfaces for many development tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll understand that: Terminal commands like cd , ls , and mkdir let you navigate and organize your file system efficiently Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, keeping your Python installations clean and manageable pip installs, updates, and removes Python packages directly from the command line Git commands track changes to your code and create snapshots called commits The command prompt displays your current directory and indicates when the terminal is ready for input This tutorial walks through the fundamentals of terminal usage on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The examples cover file system navigation, creating files and folders, managing packages with pip , and tracking code changes with Git.

Install and Open the Terminal Back in the day, the term terminal referred to some clunky hardware that you used to enter data into a computer. Nowadays, people are usually talking about a terminal emulator when they say terminal , and they mean some kind of terminal software that you can find on most modern computers. Note: There are two other terms that you might hear now and then in combination with the terminal: A shell is the program that you interact with when running commands in a terminal. A command-line interface (CLI) is a program designed to run in a shell inside the terminal. In other words, the shell provides the commands that you use in a command-line interface, and the terminal is the application that you run to access the shell. If you’re using a Linux or macOS machine, then the terminal is already built in. You can start using it right away. On Windows, you also have access to command-line applications like the Command Prompt . However, for this tutorial and terminal work in general, you should use the Windows terminal application instead. Read on to learn how to install and open the terminal on Windows and how to find the terminal on Linux and macOS. Remove ads Windows The Windows terminal is a modern and feature-rich application that gives you access to the command line, multiple shells, and advanced customization options. If you have Windows 11 or above, chances are that the Windows terminal is already present on your machine. Otherwise, you can download the application from the Microsoft Store or from the official GitHub repository . Before continuing with this tutorial, you need to get the terminal working on your Windows computer. You can follow the Your Python Coding Environment on Windows: Setup Guide to learn how to install the Windows terminal . After you install the Windows terminal, you can find it in the Start menu under Terminal . When you start the application, you should see a window that looks like this: It can be handy to create a desktop shortcut for the terminal or pin the application to your task bar for easier access. Linux You can find the terminal application in the application menu of your Linux distribution. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl + Alt + T on your keyboard or use the application launcher and search for the word Terminal . After opening the terminal, you should see a window similar to the screenshot below: How you open the terminal may also depend on which Linux distribution you’re using. Each one has a different way of doing it. If you have trouble opening the terminal on Linux, then the Real Python community will help you out in the comments below. macOS A common way to open the terminal application on macOS is by opening the Spotlight Search and searching for Terminal . You can also find the terminal app in the application folder inside Finder. When you open the terminal, you see a window that looks similar to the image below: After you launch the terminal application, you’ll see a window that waits for commands. That’s similar to when you’re interacting with a Python script that expects user input . If you want to interact with the terminal, then you need to know which terminal commands you can enter to proceed. In the next section, you’ll learn about basic terminal commands that’ll help you get started. Learn Basic Terminal Commands To work with the terminal effectively, it’s important to understand some basic terminal commands and know how to use them. Terminal commands are the instructions that you type into the terminal to execute a specific task. Depending on your operating system, you’ll run the terminal commands in a specific shell. For Linux, it’s most likely Bash , for newer macOS versions it’s Zsh , and for Windows it’s PowerShell . These shells differ in their features, but they share most of the basic commands. Note: You can think of commands as little programs that are built into your shell or can be added by external applications. In PowerShell, commands are also known as cmdlets . In this section, you’ll explore the most commonly used terminal commands. To see a preview of the commands, select your operating system from the platform switcher below: Windows Linux + macOS These are the Windows commands that you’ll cover: Command Description pwd Print the path of the current directory mkdir FOLDERPATH Create a new directory ni FILEPATH Create a new file clear Clear the terminal window ls List the contents of a folder ls -al List all the contents of a folder with info cat TARGET Show the content of TARGET cd FOLDERPATH Change into a directory cd .. Change into the parent directory echo TEXT Print TEXT to the terminal echo TEXT > TARGET Print TEXT to a file named TARGET echo TEXT >> TARGET Append TEXT to TARGET cp SOURCE TARGET Copy SOURCE to TARGET rni SOURCE TARGET Rename SOURCE to TARGET python PYTHONFILE Run PYTHONFILE The terms in uppercase letters are references to the arguments that the commands allow. These are the Linux and macOS commands that you’ll cover: Command Description pwd Print the path of the current directory mkdir FOLDERPATH Create a new directory touch FILEPATH Create a new file clear Clear the terminal window ls List the contents of a folder ls -al List all the contents of a folder with info cat TARGET Show the content of TARGET cd FOLDERPATH Change into a directory cd .. Change into the parent directory echo TEXT Print TEXT to the terminal echo TEXT > TARGET Print TEXT to a file named TARGET echo TEXT >> TARGET Append TEXT to TARGET cp SOURCE TARGET Copy SOURCE to TARGET mv SOURCE TARGET Rename or move SOURCE to TARGET python PYTHONFILE Run PYTHONFILE The terms in uppercase letters are references to the arguments that the commands allow. You’ll learn how to navigate the file system and create, edit, and delete files and directories. By the end of this section, you’ll have a solid foundation for working with the terminal and be able to perform many everyday tasks with confidence. You can take this confidence and use it to tackle other tasks in the terminal, such as using pip , interacting with Git, and building command-line interfaces with Python . Remove ads Navigate Your File System The file system is the hierarchical structure of directories and files on a computer. It’s usually what you see when you open a GUI file system application like Windows Explorer or the macOS Finder. It also happens to be an excellent place to start your terminal journey, but again, you’re just dipping a toe into all the terminal’s capabilities here. The folder that you have currently open in a file system is the current working directory (cwd). As you’ll notice, you use the working directory as a reference point for many file system operations. Understanding the file system and the current working directory as a state is important for effectively navigating and managing files and directories in the terminal. After you’ve opened the terminal app, you usually start in the user folder of your operating system. You see a command prompt that’s waiting for your input. As you’ll learn, you can use a wide variety of commands as input. But some common commands are the ones to navigate the file system. To get things started, find out what your current working directory is: Shell $ pwd /Users/realpython The pwd command stands for print working directory , which is the command that you use to determine your current location within the file system. Here pwd shows that the current working directory is /Users/realpython . The working directory is the current directory that you’re operating in. It’s where commands will be executed by default. Dig Deeper Into the Current Working Directory Show/Hide There are two terms that are worth exploring in the context of the current working directory: Environment Variables PATH Environment variables are variables that store stateful information about the environment in which the terminal is running. They can be used to store information such as the current working directory, the location of installed software, or the user’s home directory. The terminal can access and use this information to determine how to operate and where to look for files. PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories. To see what paths are in your PATH, call the following command: Windows Linux + macOS Windows PowerShell PS> ( cat ENV : Path ) -Split ";" Shell $ echo " ${ PATH //:/ \n } " When you enter a command in the terminal, the system will look for a program that matches the command in the directories listed in the PATH. The list visible after running the previous command is the list of locations that your system will look for when evaluating which program to run. To see which files and folders the /Users/realpython directory contains, you can use ls , which is short for list : Shell $ ls Applications Movies Desktop Music Documents Pictures Downloads Public Library When you type ls and press Enter , you see a list of all the items in the current working directory. In this case, the example shows the folders that you commonly find in the user directory on a macOS machine. You can also use the -a flag with the ls command, which stands for all . The -a flag shows you all the items in the current working directory, including the hidden items. Another flag that you can use is -l , which stands for long . When you use this flag along with ls , the command shows you detailed information about the items in the current working directory. You can also combine these flags to show detailed information about all the items, including the hidden ones, by using ls -al : Shell $ ls -al total 80 drwxr-xr-x+ 25 realpython staff 800 Nov 26 11:51 . drwxr-xr-x 6 root admin 192 Nov 7 13:22 .. -rw-r--r--@ 1 realpython staff 14340 Nov 7 16:04 .DS_Store drwx------ 134 realpython staff 4288 Nov 8 18:37 .Trash drwx------@ 3 realpython staff 96 Dec 3 2021 Applications drwx------@ 22 realpython staff 704 Nov 7 16:00 Desktop drwx------+ 4 realpython staff 128 Nov 17 2021 Documents drwx------+ 3 realpython staff 96 Nov 1 2021 Downloads drwx------@ 86 realpython staff 2752 Nov 7 21:08 Library drwx------ 6 realpython staff 192 Jul 12 14:53 Movies drwx------+ 4 realpython staff 128 Nov 26 2021 Music drwx------+ 4 realpython staff 128 Nov 1 2021 Pictures drwxr-xr-x+ 4 realpython staff 128 Nov 1 2021 Public The output will show the file type, permissions, owner, size, and timestamp of all the items in the current working directory, including the hidden files and folders. Here, for example, the hidden items are .DS_Store and .Trash . Note: You can recognize hidden items in the terminal by a dot ( . ) at the start of their name, but there are a couple of dot items that you shouldn’t confuse for hidden files. The single dot ( . ) in the list above represents the current directory, and the two dots ( .. ) link to the parent directory. You’ll work with both of them later in this tutorial. Hidden files and folders aren’t displayed by default. That’s okay for casual users. But for you as a developer, hidden items can be of interest. They often store configuration data or settings for various applications or the system itself. The output above may be a bit overwhelming at first. Have a look at this line to understand the output better: Shell drwx------@ 22 realpython staff 704 Nov 7 16:00 Desktop This line gives you valuable information about an item. There’s a directory named Desktop . The last modified date is November 7 at 16:00, and it has a size of 704 bytes. Apart from that, you can see information about the owner and group permissions. If you want to learn more about the file system permission notation, then you can check out the notation of traditional Unix permissions . Each folder in the output of ls represents a subfolder that’s inside your current working directory. To change the current working directory into the Desktop/ subfolder, you use the change directory command, cd : Shell $ pwd /Users/realpython $ cd Desktop $ pwd /Users/realpython/Desktop When you enter cd followed by a directory name, it’ll change the current working directory to the specified directory. After you run the command cd Desktop , the current working directory changes to /Users/realpython/Desktop . Note that you don’t specify a slash / or drive indicator like C:\ at the beginning of Desktop . Calling a path like this indicates that you want to navigate into a path that’s relative to the directory that you’re in right now. You used a relative path in the command above to navigate into a subfolder. Relative paths make it convenient to reference items in your file system because you don’t have to specify the complete path from the root directory. That being said, you can also change into any directory of your file system by using a complete or absolute path : Windows Linux + macOS On Windows, your absolute path looks like this: Windows PowerShell PS> cd C :\ Users \ realpython \ Desktop PS> pwd C:\Users\realpython\Desktop In this case, the cd command changes the current working directory to the directory C:\Users\realpython\Desktop , independently of its previous location. On Linux and macOS, you specify the absolute path with forward slashes: Shell $ cd /Users/realpython/Desktop $ pwd /Users/realpython/Desktop In this case, the cd command changes the current working directory to the directory /Users/realpython/Desktop , independently of its previous location. If you use cd with a path that doesn’t exist, then the terminal will print an error. You’ll soon learn how to create new directories. Before you do, make one last move in your file system. To move one directory up, you usually don’t use the name of the parent folder but two dots: Shell $ cd .. $ pwd /Users/realpython The two dots ( .. ) represent the parent directory of the current directory. Using cd .. moves you up one directory in the file system hierarchy. In a GUI file system application like Windows Explorer or the macOS Finder, you’d click little folder icons with your mouse cursor. In the terminal application, you use commands to perform tasks—for example, cd to move between folders and ls to get an overview of the items in a directory. Remove ads Create Files and Folders In this section, you’ll learn how to create and manage files and folders directly from the terminal with some new commands. Additionally, you’ll continue to list the contents of a directory with ls and move between folders with cd , just like you learned before. With the knowledge from this section, you’ll be able to create and organize your projects from within the terminal. Start by making sure that your current working directory is the Desktop. Then, use mkdir to create a new folder named rp_terminal : Windows Linux + macOS Navigate to the Desktop and create the new folder: Windows PowerShell PS> cd C :\ Users \ realpython \ Desktop PS> pwd C:\Users\realpython\Desktop PS> mkdir rp_terminal Navigate to the Desktop and create the new folder: Shell $ cd /Users/realpython/Desktop $ pwd /Users/realpython/Desktop $ mkdir rp_terminal You use the mkdir command to create a new directory. The command stands for make directory . Here, you name the new directory rp_terminal . Next, move into rp_terminal/ and create a new file named hello_terminal.py . Select your operating system below and use your platform-specific command accordingly: Windows Linux + macOS Move into the folder and create a new Python file: Windows PowerShell PS> cd rp_terminal PS> ni hello_terminal . py When you run the ni command, you create an empty file with the given name. In this case, the file is a Python script named hello_terminal.py . If a file with the provided name already exists, then using ni updates the file’s timestamp to the current date and time, but doesn’t change its contents. The ni command stands for new item . Move into the folder and create a new Python file: Shell $ cd rp_terminal $ touch hello_terminal.py When you run the touch command, you create an empty file with the given name. In this case, the file is a Python script named hello_terminal.py . If a file with the provided name already exists, then using touch updates the file’s timestamp to the current date and time. The touch command also updates a file’s access and modification times, even if its content remains the same. Use the long format of ls to verify that you created the file successfully: Shell $ ls -l total 0 -rw-r--r--@ 1 realpython staff 0 Nov 27 12:09 hello_terminal.py The 0 between the group and the timestamp indicates that hello_terminal.py is currently empty. You’ll use the echo command to add content to hello_terminal.py in a moment. Before you do so, have a look at what echo does when you type the command followed by some text: Shell $ echo 'print("Hello, terminal!")' print("Hello, terminal!") As a Python developer, you know that the text you just provided to echo is a print() function call . However, for the echo command, it’s a plain string , which it outputs back into the terminal. More specifically, the echo command sends the string to the standard output stream ( stdout ) . The stdout is the default destination for data that a command-line program sends. The data is displayed on the screen, but you can tell the terminal to redirect stdout to a file: Shell $ echo 'print("Hello, terminal!")' > hello_terminal.py Again, you’re using echo to output a given string. But this time, you use the caret symbol ( > ) to send the output into hello_terminal.py . Note: Be careful when redirecting the stdout to existing files. Any content that the file contains will be overwritten without warning. When you redirect the output of the echo command into a nonexistent file, then you’re creating the file in the same step. One way to check if the command worked is to list the contents of your folder again: Shell $ ls -l total 8 -rw-r--r--@ 1 realpython staff 26 Nov 27 12:12 hello_terminal.py Perfect, the size of hello_terminal.py is 26 bytes now. To verify that it contains the print() function call, you can use the cat command: Shell $ cat hello_terminal.py print("Hello, terminal!") Disappointingly, the cat command doesn’t have to do anything with cats. It’s short for concatenate . When you use cat with multiple files as arguments, you can concatenate them and display the contents one after another. If you use cat with only one file, then cat is a convenient way to display the contents of a file in the terminal. Now that you know that hello_terminal.py contains valid Python code, you can run the Python script : Shell $ python hello_terminal.py Hello, terminal! When you’re using the python command, the terminal looks for the Python executable in your PATH . If you run the python command without any arguments, then you’ll launch the interactive Python interpreter , also known as the REPL . When you run the command with a script file as an argument, then Python runs the provided script. In this case, you’re executing hello_terminal.py , and you see the output of your print() function directly in the terminal. This works because Python’s print() uses stdout by default. Note: When you run a Python script in the terminal, the script will output any error messages to the standard error stream ( stderr ). The standard error stream is a separate output channel that’s used specifically for error messages, warnings, and other diagnostic information. With this separate output channel for error messages, you can redirect or filter regular output and diagnostic messages independently. With the knowledge gained in this section, you can now create, edit, and inspect Python files within the terminal. You’re now well equipped to move on to working with a command-line tool that’s essential on your journey as a Python developer. It’s called pip , and it enables you to include external packages in your Python projects. Remove ads Install Python Packages With the Terminal The pip package manager is an essential tool for managing Python packages . To avoid installing packages directly into your system Python installation, you can use a virtual environment . A virtual environment provides an isolated Python interpreter for your project. Any packages that you use inside this environment will be independent of your system interpreter. This means that you can keep your project’s dependencies separate from other projects and the system at large. Create a Virtual Environment Python has the built-in venv module for creating virtual environments. This module helps you create virtual environments with an isolated Python installation. Once you’ve activated the virtual environment, you can install packages into this environment. The packages that you install into one virtual environment are isolated from all the other environments on your system. You can follow these steps to create and activate a virtual environment named venv : Windows Linux + macOS Windows PowerShell PS> python -m venv venv PS> venv \ Scripts \ activate (venv) PS> Shell $ python -m venv venv $ source venv/bin/activate (venv) $ Note that the command prompt has changed. This is a reminder that you’re working within the indicated virtual environment. Note: When you’re done working with this virtual environment, then you can deactivate it by running the deactivate command. When you activate a virtual environment with Python’s venv module, you’re adding a new entry to the PATH environment variable. The new entry points to the location of the virtual environment’s Python executable. This ensures that when you run Python commands or scripts, they’ll use this specific Python executable instead of any other version of Python that may be installed on your system. Install a Package In this section, you’ll install the Rich library by Will McGugan , which enables you to create colorful text user interface (TUI) applications for the terminal. Before you install rich , check which Python packages are currently installed in your virtual environment: Shell (venv) $ python -m pip list Package Version ---------- ------- pip 22.3 Running python -m pip list lists all the packages installed in the current environment. By default, pip is the only package that you’ll find when you start a new virtual environment. To install rich , use the command below: Shell (venv) $ python -m pip install rich Collecting rich ... Installing collected packages: markdown-it-py, pygments, rich Successfully installed markdown-it-py-4.0.0 mdurl-0.1.2 pygments-2.19.2 rich-14.2.0 Besides rich , you also installed some other dependencies that you need when you want to use rich . To check all the currently installed packages, you can run python -m pip list again: Shell (venv) $ python -m pip list Package Version -------------- ------- markdown-it-py 4.0.0 mdurl 0.1.2 pip 25.2 Pygments 2.19.2 rich 14.2.0 To see the capabilities that rich offers, run rich without any arguments: Shell (venv) $ python -m rich Depending on your terminal’s capabilities, you should see examples that look like this: In the screenshot above, you can get an impression of what you can do with the rich library. The terminal doesn’t have to be a dark place after all! Now that your screen is filled from top to bottom, you may want to clear your terminal window again. For this, you can use the clear command: Shell (venv) $ clear You use the clear command to clear the terminal screen. It removes all the text and content currently displayed on the terminal, leaving a blank screen. For example, you might want to clear the terminal screen before you run new commands. In some terminals, you can use Ctrl + L or Cmd + L as keyboard shortcuts to clear the screen. You’ve learned how to use pip directly from the terminal in this section. Knowing how to use pip in the terminal is crucial for any Python developer, as it allows you to effectively manage and update the packages that you use in your projects. If you want to learn more about virtual environments and pip , then you can check out Real Python’s primer on Python virtual environments and tutorial on how to use Python’s pip to manage your projects’ dependencies . Both are essential tools to make your life as a Python developer more convenient. Another helpful tool to manage your projects is Git. Read on to learn how to improve your terminal skills and dive into the world of version control with Git. Remove ads Interact With Git Git is a version control system that developers commonly use, no matter which programming language they’re writing their code in. A version control system tracks changes made to files over time and helps you revert code to a previous version if needed. In this section, you’ll learn how to interact with Git directly from the terminal. You’ll initialize a Git repository, track files, and create commits. There are a bunch of GUI clients for Git. They can be convenient to use and help you understand Git logic better by providing rich visual feedback. However, it’s still a good idea to learn the basics of interacting with Git in the terminal. Learning the basic Git terminal commands can help you understand how Git works under the hood. Initiate a Git Repository The first step in using Git is to initialize a repository . A repository is a container that holds all your project files, folders, and metadata. Create a new Git repository with the command below: Shell $ git init Initialized empty Git repository in ⮑ /Users/realpython/Desktop/rp_terminal/.git/ When you run the git init command, Git creates an empty repository in the current working directory. This creates a new subdirectory named .git/ that contains all of the necessary repository files. Note: If you get an error when you use the git command, then you may need to download and install a current version of Git for your operating system. After initializing the repository, you can check the status of your repository: Shell $ git status On branch main No commits yet Untracked files: (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) hello_terminal.py venv/ nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track) The git status command shows your repository’s current status. It displays which branch you’re on and whether or not there are any commits . A Git commit is a snapshot of the changes made to the files in a Git repository. When you make changes to your files and save them, you can take a snapshot of those changes by creating a commit on a branch. As you make new commits, the branch points to the latest commits. In this case, you’re on the main branch, and there are no commits yet. You can also create new branches to work on new features or bug fixes and then switch between branches as needed. If you want to, then you can create multiple branches to work on various versions of your codebase simultaneously. Additionally, git status shows you which files are untracked, meaning that Git isn’t tracking them. You might want to ignore specific files and folders, such as the venv/ folder, so that Git won’t track them. Which Files to Ignore Show/Hide A general rule of thumb for ignoring files in a Git repository is to ignore any files that are specific to your local development environment or files that are generated by your build process. Some examples of files that should typically be ignored include: Files containing sensitive information , such as passwords or private keys Binary files that are generated by your build process , like compiled executables or object files Files specific to your local development environment , such as virtual environment files or user-specific editor configuration files Temporary files or files created by your operating system , such as .DS_Store on macOS or Thumbs.db on Windows Log files or other files that your application generates at runtime Check out GitHub’s collection of .gitignore templates to get an overview of common .gitignore files. There you’ll also find a Python specific .gitignore example . You can ignore files in Git by creating a .gitignore file and listing the files and folders that you want to ignore in that file: Shell $ echo "venv" > .gitignore As you learned before, this command creates a new file named .gitignore and writes venv to it. Verify the current items in your Git repository by leveraging another command that you already know: Shell $ ls -a . .git hello_terminal.py .. .gitignore venv You now have a .gitignore file next to your hello_terminal.py file, your venv/ folder, and the .git/ folder. To check if Git ignores the venv/ folder, run git status again: Shell $ git status On branch main No commits yet Untracked files: (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) .gitignore hello_terminal.py nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track) Perfect, Git now only shows .gitignore and hello_terminal.py as untracked files. Git knows the files are there, but you haven’t yet added them to the repository. Remove ads Track Files With Git When you start a new project, you’ll likely want to keep track of your changes over time. In the previous section, you initialized a new repository with git init . Now it’s time to start tracking files. You use the git add command to tell Git which files you want to track: Shell $ git add . Remember the dot . in the directory listing before? The dot refers to the current directory. Using . at the end of the git add command tells Git to track all the files in the current directory. Once you’ve added files to the repository, you can check the status of your files using the git status command: Shell $ git status On branch main No commits yet Changes to be committed: (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage) new file: .gitignore new file: hello_terminal.py You can see in the output that the files hello_terminal.py and .gitignore are added and ready to be committed: Shell $ git commit -m "Initiate git repository" [main (root-commit) 7b20833] Initiate git repository 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+) create mode 100644 .gitignore create mode 100644 hello_terminal.py With the git commit command, you take a snapshot of the current state of your files and store it in the repository’s history. The -m flag allows you to include a message describing your changes. The output shows the branch that you’re on and the number of files changed. After you commit any changes, it’s a good idea to check the status of your Git repository again: Shell $ git status On branch main nothing to commit, working tree clean You can see in the output that there’s nothing to commit, meaning that all changes have been successfully committed. The workflow that you used in this section is typical when you use Git in the terminal. You use the git add command to tell Git which files to track. Then you use git commit to take a snapshot of the current state of your files and save it to the repository’s history. Additionally, it’s good practice to use git status often to check the current status of your repository. While you’ve gotten an introduction to using Git in the terminal, there’s much more that Git has to offer you as a Python developer.

Next Steps The more you use the terminal, the more comfortable you’ll get. A fun way to introduce the terminal into your workflows as a Python developer is to create Python scripts with command-line interfaces. For example, you can build a: Quiz Application With Python Site Connectivity Checker in Python Command-Line To-Do App With Python and Typer Python Directory Tree Generator for the Command Line Weather CLI App With Python Wordle Clone With Python and Rich Especially for a Python developer, knowing how to work with the terminal can be extremely useful for various reasons. Besides using pip and Git to manage your Python projects, there are even more examples of when the terminal comes in handy: Command-line interfaces: Many popular Python libraries and frameworks—such as Django , Flask , and Poetry —come with command-line interfaces that allow you to perform tasks such as creating new projects, running development servers, and managing databases. Automation and scripting: The terminal allows you to automate repetitive tasks and create scripts to manage your development workflow—for example, running tests or deploying your application . Debugging: The terminal can be useful for debugging your code. For instance, you can use print() or logging in Python to show output in the terminal and understand what’s happening in your code. You can also use pdb for debugging your Python code . Performance: Many command-line tools are faster than their GUI counterparts and ideal for working with large datasets or performing advanced tasks such as data processing and analysis . Overall, the terminal is a powerful tool that can help you streamline your development workflow, automate tasks, debug your code, and access advanced features of libraries and frameworks. With practice, you’ll find the terminal an invaluable tool for your journey as a Python developer.

These releases address the security issues detailed below. We encourage all users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible. CVE-2025-13473: Username enumeration through timing difference in mod_wsgi authentication handler The django.contrib.auth.handlers.modwsgi.check_password() function for authentication via mod_wsgi allowed remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack. Thanks to Stackered for the report. This issue has severity "low" according to the Django security policy. CVE-2025-14550: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability via repeated headers when using ASGI When receiving duplicates of a single header, ASGIRequest allowed a remote attacker to cause a potential denial-of-service via a specifically created request with multiple duplicate headers. The vulnerability resulted from repeated string concatenation while combining repeated headers, which produced super-linear computation resulting in service degradation or outage. Thanks to Jiyong Yang for the report. This issue has severity "moderate" according to the Django security policy. CVE-2026-1207: Potential SQL injection via raster lookups on PostGIS Raster lookups on GIS fields (only implemented on PostGIS) were subject to SQL injection if untrusted data was used as a band index. As a reminder, all untrusted user input should be validated before use. Thanks to Tarek Nakkouch for the report. This issue has severity "high" according to the Django security policy. CVE-2026-1285: Potential denial-of-service vulnerability in django.utils.text.Truncator HTML methods django.utils.text.Truncator.chars() and Truncator.words() methods (with html=True ) and truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters were subject to a potential denial-of-service attack via certain inputs with a large number of unmatched HTML end tags, which could cause quadratic time complexity during HTML parsing. Thanks to Seokchan Yoon for the report. This issue has severity "moderate" according to the Django security policy. CVE-2026-1287: Potential SQL injection in column aliases via control characters FilteredRelation was subject to SQL injection in column aliases via control characters, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs passed to QuerySet methods annotate() , aggregate() , extra() , values() , values_list() , and alias() . Thanks to Solomon Kebede for the report. This issue has severity "high" according to the Django security policy. CVE-2026-1312: Potential SQL injection via QuerySet.order_by and FilteredRelation QuerySet.order_by() was subject to SQL injection in column aliases containing periods when the same alias was, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, used in FilteredRelation . Thanks to Solomon Kebede for the report. This issue has severity "high" according to the Django security policy.

ModelRenderers, a possible new component to Django... - Software Crafts Menu Home About Articles 100 words In Progress ModelRenderers, a possible new component to Django... February 2, 2026 # 100 words # django # renderers # templates # models Towards the end of last year I was working with form renderers in my startup to provide a consistent interface for forms across the project. I also used template partials to override widgets, delivering consistent rendering all in one file, a nice win. This made me wonder what other common components in a project get rendered to HTML that could benefit from a single, reusable place to avoid repeating myself. Carlton's Neapolitan package already has this to some degree. There are two template tag types: one for object detail and one for object list. We also have FormRenderers in Django which already cascade from project down to an individual form, so perhaps we could apply the same logic to render models in a dry, configurable way rather than duplicating templates and logic. This made me wonder, could we have a python class whose role is to define how a model get's rendered? Let's be clear, we're not getting into serializers here and the validation or logic that comes with them, it's similar to the separation of Forms and FormRenders. I'm thinking that this idea allows the rendering of an object of list of objects in a template like so: {{ object }} {{ object_list }} This can be controlled via a class described above: class MyModelRenderer ( ModelRenderer ) : list_template = '' detail_template = '' form_renderer = MyFormRenderer The above class controls how a list of objects would be rendered along with a single object and the form renderer to use. The form side opens up the idea of chaining renderers together in order to find the correct template to use. This then links to the idea of having a template snippet for rendering related models. If you have a foreign key or a many-to-many relationship, your renderer could specify how to render itself as a related field. You could chain model renderers together so that, when rendering a related field, it looks up the appropriate snippet instead of rendering the entire detail or the entire list. This obviously would be an optional API, but a potentially interesting one. It would certainly alter the look of a Django project and of course nothing stops you from rendering by hand. To me this leans into a different approach to having shared components at the template level, pushing towards not repeating yourself where possible.

Title: In Progress: Week 63

Week 63 - In Progress - Software Crafts Menu Home About Articles 100 words In Progress Week 63 February 2, 2026 · 7 min 42 sec # podcast # weekly-standup Your browser does not support the audio element. ← All episodes RSS Feed Hey there, and welcome to Week 63, I think it’s 63, yeah, 63. It’s a new month, which means: did I make my deadline? And I kind of did. There’s still more work to do; there always is. Project Progress But last week, I went from getting the two applications live, getting staging live, and getting production live. Are there issues that need to be fixed on them? Yes, but they’re there, sitting there, and I was making some progress over the weekend. It’s the classic: like you get it live, and you go, “Oh, I can see a page,” and then you actually try to do something, and something’s broken. So, I had like issues with AWS email permissions, and then I needed to set up Stripe, and yeah, it’s like the little bits of setup that you always forget. But otherwise, yeah, I have two live applications sitting on domains. They’re password protected because we now need to submit everything for compliance. The contract got signed on Friday as well, so we need to submit it for compliance, and that’s gonna take a month or two because these things take time, and there’s gonna be probably changes that I need to make. But yeah, I have no idea how to pronounce this, but I chose Pulumi, P-U-L-U-M-I; I think it’s Pulumi. I need to look up how to pronounce it. Especially as I keep talking to my computer for like transcription, and it keeps on getting it wrong. Anyway, I went from zero to everything with that last week, which I was super impressed with. Again, it’s another: I didn’t write any of the code; Claude wrote the code, but building it up by going through one setting some standards, this is a fresh repo, setting some standards up straightaway, like this is how I’m like going through that process. And then I think about, the way I think about well, this is the way I think about building infrastructure: you’ve got like components, compute, storage, database, networking, and then you have like an application stack in, so splitting that up, and then you get to the point of just like, “I want you to build production,” or “I want you to build staging,” and it just does everything, and we got there. Technical Debt But what is, again, for me really nice about using Claude code and like the speed at which you can work: I had it post launch or like in the next couple of months to add in Tailscale for our private networking. That’s the solution I’ve chosen; it looks awesome; I’ve used it a little bit personally, but I was like, “Yeah, this would be a cool thing to use.” So, for example, they have Tailscale SSH so you have to be on the tail net to be able to SSH into the instances. It means I don’t have to open up any security groups; don’t have to deal with changing IP addresses; it just works. And yeah, instead of postponing that when I came to deal with SSH, I was like, “Oh, I could just get Claude to do it,” and it would be just as quick rather than it being a long time. It’s like it’s almost as quick to do the correct solution first time around than it is to... it generates a new type of technical debt. Like I listened to a video a couple of weeks ago about comprehension debt of my understanding or the human’s understanding versus the AI’s understanding of what’s happening in the codebase and what there actually is. So, there’s new types of technical debt, but then there are... it’s eliminating all types of technical work by reason you might have made a shortcut before that’s less than ideal. Django and Infrastructure You get to put in a proper solution which you didn’t think you had time for but you do have time for because you’re just implementing things faster. It’s an interesting juxtaposition, I will definitely say that. But yeah, I got it live by the end of Friday, which was really cool. I really enjoyed writing that production code. I say I didn’t write it; but getting that production code... yeah, getting it written and working through it just was nice. Then moving on to this week: I missed my hundred words last week, so I’m gonna write that this week. I might do two this week, so I’ve got two in my head. One around... I’ve talked about it before like model renderers, like form renderers for Django; and then also talking about infrastructure provisioning a bit and how I think about it. And then this week’s a bit of a break. Oh, the thing I did get done last week is why I booked DjangoCon. I’m going to Athens. Took a little while because I’m gonna be traveling through the night both times so it’s like I’m gonna be tired but anyway. I need to book accommodation this week and I have belittling on Thursday this week, so that’s like yeah today’s this week’s are more of a catch-up. I say catch-up; take it easy week. I’m gonna take today the rest of the day off and just enjoy. Have a bit of a break or try to enjoy myself and then it’s like taking stock of where we are and moving forward slowly. Also, exciting: I have a... I’m chatting with Will and Carlton tomorrow on DjangoChat so we’ll see what happens. I’m nervous and excited in equal measure, I think. It’s my first proper podcast recording like with other people so but I can talk well enough on to the microphone and yeah; I don’t want to make a fool of myself; I don’t think I will just; I have a question in my head whether I’m gonna listen to myself back when the episode actually comes out but you know we’ll see how that goes. The other fun thing that would like mixed in with last week was I had a few like curveballs thrown at me by clients being like, “Can you answer these questions this today or the next 24 hours?” And then also I had my it was the personal tax deadline in the UK so it’s just like my accountant like mine’s a simple one but it was like leaving it a bit close to the wire and like yeah; okay paid for that on Friday, but anyway. That’s it, I think. Yeah, as I say, taking it easy and taking stock this week of like where I’m at what I need to do and go from there, but you know that that’s life at times; you just... I’ve had a hard month; I’m pushed myself; I’m trying to reset myself a little bit and not feel like I’m used to be constantly working on the application although I do, but yeah; at a more sane pace; not doing 60-70 hours a week; reset it down to like 40; anyway, that’s all folks. Have a good week being in progress; hope you have an excellent start to February, and speak to you next week bye-bye. Comments Loading comments...

Title: What arguments was Python called with?
Date: 04-02-2026

--- FULL CONTENT ---
What arguments was Python called with? | David Lord David Lord Home Blog RSS Mastodon What arguments was Python called with? 04 Feb, 2026 Farewell to my first big PR for Werkzeug , made in 2018. Now that Python 3.9 is EOL, I'm able to remove that giant hack and replace it with a single line of code. Here's an explanation of what I did, and what replaces it. Werkzeug's reloader has to determine what arguments to start a new process with, including the Python executable, the script, whether it was run with -m , and arguments passed to the script. Unfortunately, Python doesn't make the fact that it was run as python -m module available, it replaces -m module with the path to the module in sys.argv . However, Python also has different behavior for python -m module vs python file.py : running a file adds its directory to sys.path . When the reloader was run with python -m werkzeug.serving , it would end up calling python /path/to/werkzeug/serving.py on reload, which added /path/to/werkzeug to sys.path . This caused import conflicts with module names in Werkzeug, such as http , shadowing builtins. After enough digging through internals with the debugger, I found that it is possible to detect that Python was run with -m , and re-adjust sys.argv to reflect that. This took a couple weeks of investigation, as I discovered more and more ways to install a script and corner cases. To determine if -m was used, I looked at __main__.__package__ . __main__ is the module name given to the script that was run, regardless of the name of the script or whether it was run as -m . For all the cases I could think of, it seems that if its __package__ is not None, then it was run as -m , otherwise it was run as a file. If we're running as -m , then the module name can be reconstructed by appending the name of the file in sys.argv[0] to __main__.__package__ . Beyond this, there are a few other things messing with the value. If the script is a pip-installed entry point on Windows, it's an exe but doesn't include the extension in sys.argv . Python -m a.b might refer to a module a/b.py or a package a/b/__init__.py , or a/b/__main__.py . And pydevd, the backend for many IDE debuggers, incorrectly rewrites -m script to script instead of path/to/script.py . def _get_args_for_reloading () -> list [ str ]: """Determine how the script was executed, and return the args needed to execute it again in a new process. """ rv = [ sys . executable ] py_script = sys . argv [ 0 ] args = sys . argv [ 1 :] # Need to look at main module to determine how it was executed. __main__ = sys . modules [ "__main__" ] # The value of __package__ indicates how Python was called. It may # not exist if a setuptools script is installed as an egg. It may be # set incorrectly for entry points created with pip on Windows. if getattr ( __main__ , "__package__" , None ) is None or ( os . name == "nt" and __main__ . __package__ == "" and not os . path . exists ( py_script ) and os . path . exists ( f " { py_script } .exe" ) ): # Executed a file, like "python app.py". py_script = os . path . abspath ( py_script ) if os . name == "nt" : # Windows entry points have ".exe" extension and should be # called directly. if not os . path . exists ( py_script ) and os . path . exists ( f " { py_script } .exe" ): py_script += ".exe" if ( os . path . splitext ( sys . executable )[ 1 ] == ".exe" and os . path . splitext ( py_script )[ 1 ] == ".exe" ): rv . pop ( 0 ) rv . append ( py_script ) else : # Executed a module, like "python -m werkzeug.serving". if os . path . isfile ( py_script ): # Rewritten by Python from "-m script" to "/path/to/script.py". py_module = t . cast ( str , __main__ . __package__ ) name = os . path . splitext ( os . path . basename ( py_script ))[ 0 ] if name != "__main__" : py_module += f ". { name } " else : # Incorrectly rewritten by pydevd debugger from "-m script" to "script". py_module = py_script rv . extend (( "-m" , py_module . lstrip ( "." ))) rv . extend ( args ) return rv While the answer to "how was this script called" seems like it should be simple, "just check sys.argv ", it turned out to be far more complex. And that code above still isn't complete, it doesn't capture the arguments that were passed to python besides -m , such as -u , -X , etc. That's why Python 3.10 added sys.orig_argv . It captures exactly what was passed to python , before any rewriting was done. All of the above can be replaced, with more fidelity, by: args = [ sys . executable , * sys . orig_argv [ 1 :]] #Python Unless otherwise indicated, posts are licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 , and code snippets are licensed under this MIT license .

Community involvement : Meet other Python users in person, connect with open-source contributors and maintainers, and experience the collaborative culture that defines the Python community. Professional opportunities : Discover potential job openings, meet companies using Python across industries, and form professional connections that can lead to future projects or roles. The following sections explore each category in more detail to help you recognize what matters most to you when choosing a Python conference. Personal Growth One of the biggest benefits of attending a Python conference is the opportunity for personal growth through active learning and engagement. Python conferences are organized around a program of talks , tutorials , and collaborative sessions that expose you to new ideas, tools, and ways of thinking about Python. The number of program items can range from one at local meetups to over one hundred at larger conferences like PyCon US and EuroPython . At larger events, you’re exposed to a wide breadth of topics to choose from, while at smaller events, you have fewer options but can usually attend all the sessions you’re interested in. Conference talks are an excellent opportunity to get exposed to new ideas, hear about new tools, or just listen to someone else talk about a topic you’re familiar with, which can be a very educational experience! Most of these talks are later shared on YouTube , but attending in person allows you to participate in live Q&A sessions where speakers answer audience questions directly. You also have the chance to meet the speaker after the talk and ask follow-up questions that wouldn’t be possible when watching a recording. Tutorials , on the other hand, are rarely recorded. They tend to be longer than talks and focus on hands-on coding , making them a brilliant way to gain practical, working knowledge of a Python feature or tool. Working through exercises with peers and asking questions in real time can help solidify your understanding of a topic. Some conferences also include collaborative sprint events , where you get together with other attendees to contribute to open-source projects, typically with the guidance of the project maintainers themselves: EuroPython Attendees Collaborating During the Sprints (Image: Braulio Lara ) Participating in sprints under the mentorship of the project maintainers is a great way to boost your confidence in your skills and get some open-source contributions under your belt. Community Involvement Developers are used to collaborating on open-source projects with people around the world, but working together online isn’t the same as having a face-to-face conversation. Python conferences fill that gap by giving developers a dedicated space to meet and connect in person. If you know who you’re looking for, it’s common to meet open-source contributors, library maintainers, and even CPython core developers at various Python conferences worldwide. This makes conferences a great way to finally connect with the maintainer of a Python library you keep coming back to, which can be tremendously useful for your work. On top of being able to meet some notable folks—who you’ll quickly realize are always very down-to-Earth and friendly—you’ll also have the chance to meet dozens, if not hundreds, of other Python users. From professional Python users to hobbyist Python programmers, everyone will be happy to welcome you to the conference. If you think about it, there are millions of Python users around the world. That’s more than the population of some countries. Attending a Python conference allows you to meet some of these users, making you feel like you’re part of a community instead of just another anonymous user of a programming language. Professional Opportunities Most Python conferences are organized and run by volunteers, which means sponsor companies play an important role in supporting the event. At larger Python conferences, these sponsor companies often host booths. This gives you the opportunity to talk directly with people who work at those companies, learn about the tools they build, and find out whether they’re hiring, often while picking up some free swag along the way: Real Python Swag From PyCon US 2025 At local Python meetups, companies sometimes sponsor events by lending their office space. This smaller setting can make it easier to have informal conversations and learn more about what a company does and whether they’re hiring. Beyond these types of interactions, simply chatting with other attendees is a form of networking. You never know where these serendipitous conversations might lead! As an example, I’ve personally found new professional projects through people I met at conferences while casually talking with them between sessions—connections that later turned into meaningful opportunities. Last but not least, attending a Python conference is a lot of fun, so professional connections often form naturally because conferences are enjoyable social experiences. Different conferences offer different activities, but it’s commmon to find lightning talks , Python-related quizzes, social gatherings, and other informal events that make it easy to connect with others. Remove ads Find the Best Python Conference for You to Attend Broadly speaking, Python conferences generally fall into four main categories, each offering a different experience depending on your goals and preferences: Local meetups : Smaller, shorter events that happen more often and provide an easy way to connect with the local Python community, with opportunities for deeper involvement. National PyCons : Large, multi-day events that serve as the flagship Python conferences for a country or region and attract hundreds of attendees. Topical Python conferences : Events similar in format and scale to national PyCons, but focused on a specific Python-related domain or tool. Online conferences : Fully remote events that are easy to attend and more accessible, but offer limited community interaction. The upcoming sections explore each conference type in more detail to help you understand what to expect and decide which option best fits your goals. Local Meetups Local meetups are the smallest of the four events. They’re typically tied to a specific city or region, last only a couple of hours, and happen monthly or quarterly. Attendance is usually limited, with some meetups drawing as few as 10 to 20 participants. Because local meetups are smaller and more informal, they’re a great starting point for first-time attendees to figure out what Python conferences are all about without feeling overwhelmed. The smaller size also makes it easier to have meaningful conversations with speakers and other attendees. If you become a recurring attendee at your local meetup, you’ll soon find yourself building relationships with your local Python community. Another benefit of attending your local meetup is that it doesn’t require a major financial commitment, since you don’t have to pay for a ticket, travel, or accommodation. To find a local meetup near you, try searching online for “Python meetup” along with the name of your city or region. National PyCons National PyCons are the largest of the four event types. These annual conferences tend to have an international reach and are often branded as being the Python conference for a given country or region. For example, PyCon Portugal is the national Python conference held in Portugal. PyCons can last a few days—typically anywhere from two to five days—with larger conferences like PyCon US and EuroPython lasting a week or more. Their schedules are usually organized into days dedicated to tutorials, talks, and sprints. Because they last multiple days, national PyCons provide plenty of opportunities to catch talks and tutorials about topics that interest you: EuroPython Attendees During a Keynote Session (Image: Braulio Lara ) Attendance at PyCons varies widely. Smaller PyCons may host around 100 attendees, while larger ones attract 500 to 800 participants, with EuroPython drawing over 1,000 attendees and PyCon US exceeding 2,500 in some years. As the largest Python events, these conferences also attract many sponsors, creating plenty of opportunities for networking and professional conversations. As mentioned earlier, another benefit of the larger conferences is that organizers arrange fun social activities like tours of the host city and dinners. At these events, it’s common to end the day sharing a meal with people you didn’t know at the start of the day. These interactions tend to happen organically—even if you consider yourself an introvert—and provide an easy way to make new connections. The official Python website has an events section that lists many Python conferences around the world. If you don’t find one for your country, try searching online, as there are many Python conferences not listed on that page. Topical Python Conferences Local meetups and national PyCons tend to be “about Python” in the broadest sense, with talks covering a wide range of tools and topics. Some Python tools and use cases have a bigger user base than others, so the community started organizing conferences dedicated to specific Python-related topics . The most well-known topical Python conferences are the DjangoCon US and DjangoCon EU conferences, which focus on Django , and the PyData conferences , dedicated to the world of data science and related fields. These conferences are usually held annually, last for a few days, and provide excellent opportunities if you work in or are particularly interested in the conference’s subject area. The social and community benefits of attending a topical conference are very similar to those of national PyCons. The key difference lies in the program, as talks and tutorials at topical conferences are tightly focused on the subject matter of the event. From a professional perspective, it’s also worth noting that a topical conference will attract sponsors that are specifically interested in meeting Python users of that domain. If you’re looking for professional opportunities related to a particular area of Python, then attending a topical conference may be your best bet. Remove ads Online Conferences There are also some Python conferences that run 100% online, with one of the most well-known examples being PyLadiesCon , a global conference organized by the PyLadies mentorship group . Online conferences offer a different experience from in-person events, but because they’re easier to attend, they can be a great place to start. Note: Some local meetups, national PyCons, and topical conferences also offer remote participation options, allowing attendees to join from home. If you attend one of these events remotely, it’s worth keeping in mind that the experience may differ from attending in person, as some activities and interactions are limited to on-site participants. An online conference can be a great first conference since tickets are typically more affordable and there’s no need to budget for travel or accommodation. At the same time, the online format reduces many of the social interactions that happen naturally at in-person events, which can make it harder to get involved with the community and form serendipitous connections with other attendees. Python Conference Comparison By now, you know how each type of Python conference offers a different experience, depending on what you’re hoping to get out of attending. The table below summarizes the main reasons you might choose one type of conference over another: Conference Type Why You Might Attend Learning Experience Community Experience Local Meetups To meet local Python users and get involved gradually Short talks and light learning Strong, informal, and local National PyCons To explore Python broadly and build professional connections Wide range of talks and tutorials Large, diverse, and highly social Topical Python Conferences To go deep into a specific tool or domain Focused, in-depth learning Targeted and domain-specific Online Conferences To attend a conference with minimal cost or travel Talk-centric and convenient More limited than in-person events If you’re unsure which type of conference to attend, start by identifying the single most important outcome you’re looking for. Once you’ve clarified that goal, you can refer to this table to find the type of event that best aligns with it. Take Your First Steps Toward Attending a Conference By now, you should have an idea of the type of conference you’d like to attend, and hopefully, this will be the first of many. The steps below outline a simple, low-pressure way to get started. Stay Updated The very first thing you can do is make sure you stay on top of conference news. This is a low-effort way to engage with your conference of choice and helps ensure you’re aware of important dates and updates. For example, if you want to stay up to date with PyCon US, you could: Follow the conference on social media : For example, you can stay on top of updates about PyCon US on Mastodon . Subscribe to the conference newsletter : The PyCon US newsletter provides firsthand updates about when registration opens, when dates for the next event are announced, and other major milestones. Join the conference’s online community spaces: Many conferences offer Discord, Meetup, or Slack groups where you can start casually interacting with other attendees between events. By doing these, you’re putting yourself in the loop , effectively kickstarting your conference involvement in a natural, low-pressure way. Get More Involved If you want to get more involved with the community, there are two additional options to consider. These are entirely optional, but they can significantly improve your overall conference experience: Volunteer at the conference: Most Python meetups and conferences are run by volunteers, and offering your help is a great way to support the event while meeting people along the way. Speak at the conference Speaking at a conference brings a lot of benefits in and of itself, so consider proposing a talk for the conference you’d like to attend. If it’s a local meetup, reaching out to the meetup organizers is often enough. If it’s a larger Python conference, you’ll need to go through the call for proposals (CfP) . If a 20 to 30 minute talk feels intimidating, signing up for a 5-minute lightning talk can be a great first step. Paradoxically, volunteering and speaking at a conference can be very helpful if you’re shy or new to the community. Volunteering helps you naturally connect with the organizers, other volunteers, and the attendees you end up helping. By speaking, you automatically have a built-in conversation starter, and you have the added benefit that people will often come to you to chat about your talk. Set Expectations If you’re thinking of going to a national PyCon or a topical conference, it’s helpful to set a few expectations ahead of time: You don’t need to attend every talk: The talk schedule is usually packed, often with multiple tracks running simultaneously. The “hallway track” refers to the informal conversations that happen outside the talk rooms, where many spontaneous and meaningful interactions take place. Be on the lookout for social events: These typically happen at the end of the day, and are an important part of the overall conference experience. Expect a welcoming environment: The Python community strives to make Python conferences as welcoming as possible for everyone . For example, many Python conferences observe the Pacman rule , which encourages people chatting in a circle to leave an open space so others can easily join in the conversation. Setting a few expectations ahead of time can make the experience feel more manageable and enjoyable. It gives you permission to participate in ways that fit your energy, interests, and goals. Remove ads Address Common Concerns Some attendees of national PyCons and topical conferences may have concerns. Common ones include the financial investment required and the potential overwhelm of entering a space where you don’t know anyone yet. If you work with Python, consider asking your company to cover the cost of the conference ticket, travel, and accommodation. Frame attendance as an investment in your skills . If your company can’t support the cost and paying out of pocket isn’t feasible, look into financial aid options, as many larger conferences offer assistance programs. To help make your case, it can be useful to know that many attendees continue to balance some work responsibilities while attending conferences. For example, it’s common for people to take important meetings during the event when necessary. If you feel hesitant about meeting new people, remember that Python conferences are designed to be friendly and welcoming environments. Attending with a friend or colleague is always an option, and if large crowds become overwhelming, many conferences offer a quiet room where you can step away, rest, or work in silence whenever you need to. Next Steps You’ve explored why Python conferences are valuable and what different types of events have to offer. The steps below help you turn that understanding into a simple, actionable plan: Pick a conference you’d like to attend. Mark the conference date on your calendar. Stay up to date with the conference news . Read up on how to make the most of a larger conference . Following these steps helps set you up for success at your first conference and turns it into an experience that supports your learning, builds confidence, and strengthens your connection to the Python community.

Recent trends in the work of the Django Security Team | Weblog | Django Skip to main content Django The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines. Menu Main navigation Overview Download Documentation News Code Issues Community Foundation ♥ Donate Search Submit Toggle theme (current theme: auto) Toggle theme (current theme: light) Toggle theme (current theme: dark) Toggle Light / Dark / Auto color theme News & Events Recent trends in the work of the Django Security Team Posted by Jacob Walls on Feb. 4, 2026 Yesterday, Django issued security releases mitigating six vulnerabilities of varying severity. Django is a secure web framework, and that hasn’t changed. What feels new is the remarkable consistency across the reports we receive now. Almost every report now is a variation on a prior vulnerability. Instead of uncovering new classes of issues, these reports explore how an underlying pattern from a recent advisory might surface in a similar code path or under a slightly different configuration. These reports are often technically plausible but only sometimes worth fixing. Over time, this has shifted the Security Team’s work away from discovery towards deciding how far a given precedent should extend and whether the impact of the marginal variation rises to the level of a vulnerability. Take yesterday’s releases: We patched a “low” severity user enumeration vulnerability in the mod_wsgi authentication handler ( CVE 2025-13473 ). It’s a straightforward variation on CVE 2024-39329 , which affected authentication more generally. We also patched two potential denial-of-service vulnerabilities when handling large, malformed inputs. One exploits inefficient string concatenation in header parsing under ASGI ( CVE 2025-14550 ). Concatenating strings in a loop is known to be slow, and we’ve done fixes in public where the impact is low. The other one ( CVE 2026-1285 ) exploits deeply nested entities. December’s vulnerability in the XML serializer ( CVE 2025-64460 ) was about those very two themes. Finally, we also patched three potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. One envisioned a developer passing unsanitized user input to a niche feature of the PostGIS backend ( CVE 2026-1207 ), much like CVE 2020-9402 . Our security reporting policy assumes that developers are aware of the risks when passing unsanitized user input directly to the ORM. But the division between SQL statements and parameters is well ingrained, and the expectation is that Django will not fail to escape parameters. The last two vulnerabilities ( CVE 2026-1287 and CVE 2026-1312 ) targeted user-controlled column aliases, the latest in a stream of reports stemming from CVE 2022-28346 , involving unpacking **kwargs into .filter() and friends, including four security releases in a row in late 2025. You might ask, “who would unpack **kwargs into the ORM?!” But imagine letting users name aggregations in configurable reports. You would have something more like a parameter, and so you would appreciate some protection against crafted inputs. On top of all that, on a nearly daily basis we get reports duplicating other pending reports, or even reports about vulnerabilities that have already been fixed and publicized. Clearly, reporters are using LLMs to generate (initially) plausible variations. Security releases come with costs to the community. They interrupt our users’ development workflows, and they also severely interrupt ours. There are alternatives. The long tail of reports about user-controlled aliases presents an obvious one: we can just re-architect that area. (Thanks to Simon Charette for a pull request doing just that!) Beyond that, there are more drastic alternatives. We can confirm fewer vulnerabilities by placing a higher value on a user's duty to validate inputs, placing a lower value on our prior precedents, or fixing lower severity issues publicly. The risk there is underreacting, or seeing our development workflow disrupted anyway when a decision not to confirm a vulnerability is challenged. Reporters are clearly benefiting from our commitment to being consistent. For the moment, the Security Team hopes that reacting in a consistent way—even if it means sometimes issuing six patches—outweighs the cost of the security process. It’s something we’re weighing. As always, keep the responsibly vetted reports coming to security@djangoproject.com. Back to Top Additional Information Support Django!

Lunch Talk Series: Django needs you! (to do code review) February 01, 2026 This iteration of the Lunch Talk Series will be covering Sarah Boyce’s excellent DjangoCon Europe 2025 Keynote, “Django needs you! (to do code review)” . You should watch this if: You’re interested in doing code reviews for Django You want to be more involved in the Django community You’re looking for resources on performing code reviews You’d like an example of a well-done talk This talk covers a variety of topics: An overview of the challenge of code reviews for the Django framework The process for committing code to Django An approach to code reviews for Django (that’s accessible to everyone!) The attention problem An engaging question and answer section with the community Sarah is one of my favorite speakers as well as one of my favorite people. She’s extremely charismatic and presents as her full self. I always find myself laughing during her talks. This talk is no different, she presents a technical and important topic in a way that’s fun to follow along. My personal takeaway is to focus my code review (and contribution) efforts on a single area of the codebase. I haven’t been good about this in the past and I’ve heard this feedback several times in the past year. Hopefully this time it sticks!

Title: Agentic Engineering

AddyOsmani.com - Agentic Engineering Home GitHub Press Biography Talks --> Mastodon --> LinkedIn Twitter Subscribe --> Newsletter Shop --> Blog Agentic Engineering February 4, 2026 A year ago, Andrej Karpathy coined “vibe coding” to describe a gleefully reckless way of programming: you prompt, hand the keyboard to an AI, accept everything it spits out, don’t read the diffs, iterate by pasting error messages back in. It was a great label for a real thing - building quick prototypes or MVPs on pure AI autopilot. The problem is that “vibe coding” has become a suitcase term. People now use it to describe everything from a weekend hack to a disciplined engineering workflow where AI agents handle implementation under human oversight. These are fundamentally different activities, and conflating them is causing real confusion - and real damage. What vibe coding actually is Vibe coding means going with the vibes and not reviewing the code . That’s the defining characteristic. You prompt, you accept, you run it, you see if it works. If it doesn’t, you paste the error back and try again. You keep prompting. The human is a prompt DJ, not an engineer. This is genuinely useful for: Greenfield MVPs, prototypes and hackathon demos. You need something working by Sunday. Code quality is irrelevant. Personal scripts and one-off tools. You’re the only user. If it breaks, you regenerate it. Learning and exploration. Newcomers can build things they couldn’t otherwise, learning by example from the AI’s output. Creative brainstorming. Deliberately over-generating to see what approaches the AI suggests, then throwing it away and building properly. If vibe coding gives millions of people the ability to create custom software who otherwise couldn’t, that’s a genuine win. The technique has a legitimate place in the toolbox. But the failure modes are well-documented at this point. The pattern is always the same: it demos great, then reality arrives. You try to modify it, scale it, or secure it, and you discover nobody understands what the code is actually doing. As one engineer put it, “This isn’t engineering, it’s hoping.” We need a better term for the professional version Here’s the thing: a lot of experienced engineers are now getting massive productivity gains from AI - 2x, 5x, sometimes more - while maintaining code quality. But the way they work looks nothing like vibe coding. They’re writing specs before prompting. They’re reviewing every diff. They’re running test suites. They’re treating the AI like a fast but unreliable junior developer who needs constant oversight. I’ve personally liked “AI-assisted engineering” and have talked about how this describes that end of the spectrum where the human remains in the loop. Simon Willison (whose work I adore) proposed “ vibe engineering ” for this - it reclaims “vibe” while adding “engineering” to signal discipline. But after watching the community debate this for months, I think the the word “vibe” carries too much baggage. It signals casualness. When you tell a CTO you’re “vibe engineering” their payment system, you can see the concern on their face. Andrej Karpathy suggested “ agentic engineering ” this week and I think I like it. Here’s perhaps why it works: It describes what’s actually happening. You’re orchestrating AI agents - coding assistants that can execute, test, and refine code - while you act as architect, reviewer, and decision-maker. You might write only a % of the code by hand. The rest comes from agents working under your direction. That’s agentic. And you’re applying engineering discipline throughout. That’s engineering. It’s professionally legible. “Agentic engineering” sounds like what it is: a serious engineering discipline involving autonomous agents. You can say it to your VP of Engineering without embarrassment. You can put it in a job description. You can build a team practice around it. It draws a clean line. Vibe coding = YOLO. Agentic engineering = AI does the implementation, human owns the architecture, quality, and correctness. The terminology itself enforces the distinction. What agentic engineering looks like in practice, perhaps. The workflow isn’t complicated, but it requires discipline that vibe coding explicitly abandons: You start with a plan. Before prompting anything, you write a design doc or spec - sometimes with AI assistance. You break the work into well-defined tasks. You decide on the architecture. This is the part vibe coders skip, and it’s exactly where projects go off the rails. You direct, then review. You give the AI agent a well-scoped task from your plan. It generates code. You review that code with the same rigor you’d apply to a human teammate’s PR. If you can’t explain what a module does, it doesn’t go in. You test relentlessly. The single biggest differentiator between agentic engineering and vibe coding is testing. With a solid test suite, an AI agent can iterate in a loop until tests pass, giving you high confidence in the result. Without tests, it’ll cheerfully declare “done” on broken code. Tests are how you turn an unreliable agent into a reliable system. You own the codebase. You maintain documentation. You use version control and CI. You monitor production. The AI accelerates the work, but you’re responsible for the system. Teams doing this well often report faster development - and those gains come from augmenting a solid process, not abandoning one. The AI handles boilerplate and grunt work. The human focuses on architecture, correctness, edge cases, and long-term maintainability. The irony is that AI-assisted development actually rewards good engineering practices more than traditional coding does. The better your specs, the better the AI’s output. The more comprehensive your tests, the more confidently you can delegate. The cleaner your architecture, the less the AI hallucinates weird abstractions. As one analysis noted, “AI didn’t cause the problem; skipping the design thinking did.” The skill gap we’ve discussed Here’s an uncomfortable truth from the trenches: agentic engineering disproportionately benefits senior engineers. If you have deep fundamentals - you understand system design, security patterns, performance tradeoffs - you can leverage AI as a massive force multiplier. You know what good code looks like, so you can efficiently review and correct AI output. But if you’re junior and you lean on AI before building those fundamentals, you risk a dangerous skill atrophy. You can produce code without understanding it. You can ship features without learning why certain patterns exist. Several engineering leaders have flagged this as an emerging crisis: a generation of developers who can prompt but can’t debug, who can generate but can’t reason about what they’ve generated. This isn’t an argument against AI-assisted development. It’s an argument for being honest about what it demands. Agentic engineering isn’t easier than traditional engineering - it’s a different kind of hard. You’re trading typing time for review time, implementation effort for orchestration skill, writing code for reading and evaluating code. The fundamentals matter more, not less. Where we go from here The trajectory is clear: AI agents are getting more capable, and the agentic engineering workflow is becoming default for a growing number of professional developers. This is going to accelerate. We need: Honest terminology. Call it agentic engineering when you mean disciplined, agent-assisted development with human oversight. Call it vibe coding when you mean the fun, reckless, prototyping-only version. Stop using one term for both. Better evaluation frameworks. We need systematic ways to measure whether AI-assisted workflows are actually producing reliable software, not just faster software. Investment in fundamentals. As AI handles more implementation, the premium on architectural thinking, security awareness, and systems design goes up, not down. Training programs need to adapt. The rise of AI coding doesn’t replace the craft of software engineering - it raises the bar for it. The developers who’ll thrive aren’t the ones who prompt the fastest. They’re the ones who think the clearest about what they’re building and why, then use every tool available - including AI agents - to build it well. Vibe coding showed us what’s possible when you drop all conventions. Now it’s time to bring the engineering back. Let’s call that what it is. I’ve written a new book with O’Reilly, Beyond Vibe Coding , that goes deeper into practical frameworks for AI-Assisted (and agentic) engineering. If you’ve been figuring this out in your own workflow, I’d love to hear what’s working. Addy Osmani --> Addy Osmani is a Software Engineer at Google working on Google Cloud and Gemini.
