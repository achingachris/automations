Week 65 - In Progress - Software Crafts Menu Home About Articles 100 words In Progress Week 65 February 16, 2026 · 7 min 30 sec # podcast # weekly-standup Your browser does not support the audio element. ← All episodes RSS Feed hello, and welcome to week 65. I always have to check 64. Last week was interesting. Started off fairly well, but, yeah, I got ill, and then also we had child care issues, so I kind of what was supposed to be a relaxing week turned into less of a relaxing week. But I did get some like I spent some time doing some admin and trying to trying to ease off to that before like things really ramp up again. Week 65 Highlights We had some good news as well, like some things moved forward, and we got some information about like personal things, like trying to do an extension, and that kind of thing. In terms of work, what did I get them? The main thing in terms of work is I discovered the idea of test case management, which is something that I had in my head where we've got these main user flows, and I want to continually test them or record them, and end-to-end testing. I've signed up to a company called Qase and I'm testing it out to see if we can have our main flows and define our main flows in there. Yeah, need to see how it goes, but I'm still setting up, but the idea that just if any of those fail like I know that we want to just regularly test those flows, and if I want to know if I break things in them while touching other areas, and I say that because I'm trying to build this system so that we use component like we've got like a slide out draw modal component, and I'm like as I'm altering that with more edge cases or different conditions, I don't want another page to randomly break because I've I've changed something. So yeah, that's last week. It was a good end to the week though. My co-founder really likes the solid base of a start-up of a product that we have, and we went through and picked out like what's missing, what needs adjusting. I also got access to the compliance project with stripe, so there are things are there, of course, there are things I've missed, so I need to get build those with some urgency, so we're not again, we're not delaying ourselves, and getting live will be part of the focus this week. It's half term this week, so like today, I'm having a half day effectively because I'm taking we're doing an escape room again, and I'm taking my son climbing. But then there's and then I'm also halfway through the week taking him to my mum's so they can have some time together, and I can continue working. So a day offline which means I can spend a day fixing tests hopefully anyway. Upcoming Tasks Other things I'm thinking about doing what else is there as a result? Yeah, I've not put much on my to-do list this week. The main other thing is like yeah confirm the priority of these tickets and then get on and do them. But then also I'm still I need to dig into Django waffle and understand how I can maybe add a field which might require me resetting the whole database because I think it's a swappable model, which is a bit but better the pain now than regretting it later. Community Discussion But and I've not yet really started in production so I can destroy that and restart. But yeah, I kind of want to add dates to the waffle models to kind of hook in our development flow. And also not that it's on here but on my I have my like written to-do list, but I did I want to look at looking at new Claude improvements there's like teams of agents you can enable now and also on look at like building out custom skills specifically for this project so that's another thing. Yeah, there's plenty for me to be getting on with with not enough time as always seems to be the way. But I need to get back into reading is what home so I can catch up too many things too many things. The other thing that happened last week was discord announcing kind of like the age verification which kicked off a few discussions in different places. Django moving away from discord we're not moving anytime soon, but I think one helpful framing that Benjamin I'm not gonna butcher his own but someone proposed the idea of primary platforms and secondary platforms. And this god for Django is currently a primary platform, but whether it means to a secondary platform and we have a new chat primary platform might be a thing. But yeah, I'm not rushing and I'm not doing any knee-jerk like I'd like to see some like ground-up I'm talking about writing down the values and writing down the purpose and the vision and documenting that so that we really understand why we're doing the move. And it's not an air quotes political knee-jerk reaction to a company following probably the UK law that's come in recently. And yeah, they might not be using the best tech and that but it's the one that they've been sold to or yeah it's background deals right you can't really do much about them. But that's the choice that they make as a private company. It's also like not abandoning discord because I do think we went there to attract people, and we have it's the biggest community space that Django has that we know about that's official like that that thesis of being where the people are has proven true. So but then we've not really invested in pulling people like of that size. It's a lot of drive bike people asking for help. So is that growing the community tough choice. But then there is definitely a core community there that hang out every day, so that's yeah no easy answers, no easy only hard questions and hard answers. But anyway, that's my pondering for the last week in this week. I hope you have a good week, and speak to you next week, folks have a good one. Comments Loading comments...

Title: Learning the violin, a lesson in obstinate rigor

--- FULL CONTENT ---
Learning the violin, a lesson in obstinate rigor · Better Simple Mentoring Learn Blog About Contact Let's Meet! Mentoring Learn Blog About Contact Let's Meet! Learning the violin, a lesson in obstinate rigor February 16, 2026 Back in October, I decided to learn the violin. With the downtime from quitting my job, I was eager to learn a brand new skill. I’ve wanted to be able to play the violin for at least a decade but never made the time for it. With all that spare time and the desire to acquire a new skill, everything’s coming up Milhouse 1 . Here’s the thing though: my only musical education was in elementary school. There was a semester where we played the recorder. It was a Catholic elementary school, so I’m sure my parents were wondering why hell had been brought to their house. Beyond tooting on the recorder, every kid had to participate in choir at the school. My vocal talent was, umm, not great. I vividly remember a lesson where I was practicing as a part of a trio where the teacher pointedly asked me to “move back from the microphone.” That was a real confidence booster Mrs. N! Coming back to reality and away from trivial childhood trauma, here I am at 36, wanting to learn an instrument without knowing how to play any music, read music, or generally having any understanding of musical instruments. I mean, I did understand harmonies of stringed instruments, but that was because of my physics classes. By all accounts, this was a bad idea. Not to mention the seemingly constant barrage of information that said the violin is the hardest instrument to learn. Not just hard. The hardest 2 . And wow, the violin is difficult to play. There are just so many damn things to keep in mind. You have to move the bow at a constant speed. The angle of the bow should remain constant. The bow shouldn’t slide up and down the strings. The muscle groups you use to move the bow change about the midpoint of the bow. Don’t press too hard, but the G string needs to be pressed harder than the E string. When you stop, stop all at once; don’t gradually stop and definitely don’t go in reverse 3 . Don’t grip the bow too tightly, or your hand will start to shake 4 . And that’s just one hand! The other hand is doing some wild contortions as if I’m casting a spell. This hand is generally easier to figure out since there isn’t constant motion; it’s all about positioning. However, when you’re first learning, those positions are brand new, so it involves conscious thought. And of course that takes your mind away from the bow hand, and now the screeching starts. And the cursing. And the sweating because you’re paying someone to listen to this madness. And then thoughts of, “Is this really how I want to spend my time?” kick in. And while you’re standing there, simmering in frustration and the physical inability to multitask, the instructor says, “Now remember, we need to play this to the beat. 1 and 2 and 3 and 4”. For fuck’s sake, I forgot about the beat! And crap, that note needs to be played for two beats. Did I mention that you need to learn another language while doing this too? Yeah, this definitely classifies as hard to do. But I am getting better at it. As my friend said, “Hey, that almost sounded like music!” I’m thankful for my teacher. One lesson, I had already been pushed to my edge, and he wanted to introduce a new topic. I told him, “I will, but I’m pretty uncomfortable right now.” He responded, “That’s what we’re here for.” And with that, my edge was pushed much further out. Did the sweating stop? No. Did my frustration abate? Absolutely not. But did I want to come back next week? Heck yes. And that’s where I’m at today. I’ve made the choice that for any one of my “work days”, I will play the violin, read a professional development book (and take notes), and exercise for at least 20 minutes. No exceptions. My streak is up to about ~23 days. The results of consistent practice are pretty evident to me. There’s less scratching. There’s more consistency in the half and eighth notes. When I play the songs right, it feels good. Things sound right . That’s not to say there isn’t cursing, shouts of “Come on, Tim, this isn’t that hard!” and frustration-induced back sweat. But there’s improvement. And perhaps more importantly, I can see the future where it’s feasible for me to play an actual, modern song 5 . This is a reference to the Simpsons character Milhouse celebrating a fairly pointless victory. ↩ I doubt it’s the hardest instrument to learn. I’d be willing to bet the theremin is more challenging. ↩ I’ve avoided telling my instructor this is physically impossible, but I’m not above mentioning it here. And yes, I understand it’s about reducing the gradual slowing as much as possible, not actually removing it. ↩ This may be a Tim thing and not a general thing. ↩ Pretty much any song from the album “Elizabeth” by Zach Bryan. ↩ Previous Post Related Articles Lunch Talk Series: Privilege Arbitrage This iteration of the Lunch Talk Series will be covering Kojo Idrissa’s insightful PyDX talk, “Privilege Arbitrage”.

Unlike a traditional relational database, which stores records across multiple linked tables, a document-oriented database stores its information as separate documents in a key-value structure. The keys are similar to the field headings, or attributes, in a relational database table, while the values are similar to the table’s attribute values. TinyDB uses the familiar Python dictionary for its document structure and stores its documents in a JSON file . TinyDB is written in Python, making it easily extensible and customizable, with no external dependencies or server setup needed. Despite its small footprint, it still fully supports the familiar database CRUD features of creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents using an API that’s logical to use. The table below will help you decide whether TinyDB is a good fit for your use case: Use Case TinyDB Possible Alternatives Local, small dataset, single-process use (scripts, CLIs , prototypes) ✅ simpleJDB , Python’s json module , SQLite Local use that requires SQL, constraints, joins, or stronger durability — SQLite, PostgreSQL Multi-user, multi-process, distributed, or production-scale systems — PostgreSQL, MySQL , MongoDB Whether you’re looking to use a small NoSQL database in one of your projects or you’re just curious how a lightweight database like TinyDB works, this tutorial is for you.

You’ll receive a score upon completion to help you track your learning progress: Interactive Quiz TinyDB: A Lightweight JSON Database for Small Projects If you're looking for a JSON document-oriented database that requires no configuration for your Python project, TinyDB could be what you need. Get Ready to Explore TinyDB TinyDB is a standalone library, meaning it doesn’t rely on any other libraries to work. You’ll need to install it, though. You’ll also use the pprint module to format dictionary documents for easier reading, and Python’s csv module to work with CSV files. You don’t need to install either of these because they’re included in Python’s standard library . So to follow along, you only need to install the TinyDB library in your environment. First, create and activate a virtual environment , then install the library using pip : Shell (venv) $ python -m pip install tinydb Alternatively, you could set up a small pyproject.toml file and manage your dependencies using uv . When you add documents to your database, you often do so manually by creating Python dictionaries. In this tutorial, you’ll do this, and also learn how to work with documents already stored in a JSON file. You’ll even learn how to add documents from data stored in a CSV file. These files will be highlighted as needed and are available in this tutorial’s downloads. You might want to download them to your program folder before you start to keep them handy: Get Your Code: Click here to download the free sample code you’ll use in this tutorial to explore TinyDB. Regardless of the files you use or the documents you create manually, they all rely on the same world population data. Each document will contain up to six fields, which become the dictionary keys used when the associated values are added to your database: Field Description continent The continent the country belongs to location Country date Date population count made % of world Percentage of the world’s population population Population source Source of population As mentioned earlier, the four primary database operations are C reate, R ead, U pdate, and D elete—collectively known as the CRUD operations . In the next section, you’ll learn how you can perform each of them. To begin with, you’ll explore the C in CRUD. It’s time to get creative. Remove ads Create Your Database and Documents The first thing you’ll do is create a new database and add some documents to it. To do this, you create a TinyDB() object that includes the name of a JSON file to store your data. Any documents you add to the database are then saved in that file. Documents in TinyDB are stored in tables. Although it’s not necessary to create a table manually, doing so can help you organize your documents, especially when working with multiple tables. To start, you create a script named create_db.py that initializes your first database and adds documents in several different ways. The first part of your script looks like this: Python create_db.py 1 from csv import DictReader 2 3 from tinydb import TinyDB 4 5 with TinyDB ( "countries.json" , indent = 4 ) as countries_db : 6 countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) You import DictReader from Python’s built-in csv module. This allows you to read a CSV file and parse its header row and data rows into a Python dictionary . You also import the TinyDB class to enable you to create a database. Then you create a database and a table. To create the database, you make a TinyDB instance in line 6 of your code. To do this, you provide the name of the file, countries.json , where the database will store its documents, and an optional indent parameter of 4 . When you save your data, it’s stored as JSON. By passing indent=4 , the JSON file will be indented within the file, making it more readable. How indent Improves Readability Show/Hide If you’re curious to see the difference the indent parameter makes to your JSON file, first look inside countries.json , then delete it to avoid adding the same documents a second time. Finally, run your code without indent . In the updated file, you’ll see that it’s less readable. You’ll also notice that unique document identifiers have been added for each document. You’ll learn more about these later. In line 6, you create the database and reference it using the countries_db variable. You do this within a context manager . This means your database remains open while the indented code below the with keyword runs and then automatically closes afterward. Had you not used the context manager, you’d need to call countries_db.close() to close the database manually. You then create the table in line 7 of your code using the .table() method of your database. In this example, you’ve chosen countries as the table’s name and countries_table as its reference variable. At this point, you have your database with one empty table. Note: In this example, you create your own table. This isn’t strictly necessary. If you don’t create a table, then one named _default will be created for you. It’s considered good practice to give your table a sensible name for code readability. Also, if you’ve got multiple tables in your database, having one of them named _default will look out of place beside the others. Next, you’ll investigate three ways to add documents. First up is how to add a single document: Python create_db.py 8 countries_table . insert ( 9 { "location" : "Vatican City" , "population" : 501 } 10 ) Starting at line 8, you use the .insert() method to insert a single document into countries_table . Documents are formed from Python dictionaries. In this case, you create a document containing two fields: location and population , along with their associated values. Now, suppose you want to add multiple documents at once: Python create_db.py 12 countries_table . insert_multiple ( 13 [ 14 { "location" : "India" , "population" : 1_417_492_000 }, 15 { "location" : "China" , "population" : 1_408_280_000 }, 16 ] 17 ) You can add multiple documents by passing a Python list of them to your table’s .insert_multiple() method. In this case, your list contains two dictionaries, each representing a separate document. As before, each document contains both location and population information. Sometimes, you may need to add a larger number of documents. For example, you might want to create documents from a file of data extracted from another system. While this feature isn’t supported natively by TinyDB, you can use your existing Python skills to read this file into your database. In this example, you add the three documents stored in your countries_file.csv file: CSV countries_file.csv location,population,continent Argentina,45929925,South America Switzerland,8990428,Europe Mozambique,36147236,Africa The countries_file.csv file’s first row defines the location , population , and continent fields, which will form the dictionary keys, while the three additional rows define the values. Notice that the continent field wasn’t included in the previous documents you added. This is fine because documents in a document-oriented database don’t all need to have the same fields. To add these documents to your database, you convert them into Python dictionary format and insert them as before. You continue your script as follows: Python create_db.py 19 with open ( "countries_file.csv" , "r" ) as csv_source : 20 reader = DictReader ( csv_source ) 21 22 for row in reader : 23 row [ "population" ] = int ( row [ "population" ]) 24 countries_table . insert ( row ) In line 19, you use another context manager , this time to open countries_file.csv for reading. You then pass the file, which you refer to as csv_source , to a new DictReader() object named reader . The DictReader() parses the information in each row of your countries_file.csv file into a series of Python dictionaries, with keys from the first row and values from the remaining rows. Your DictReader() , in line 20, is an iterable , meaning that it can be used in a for loop. You use the for loop in line 22 to read each of the dictionaries from your DictReader() , and then pass them into your database table using the .insert() method as before. Just before you do so, you cast the population values to integers since DictReader reads them as strings. With your database creation script now complete, all you need to do to create your database is run the script : Shell (venv) $ python create_db.py If you want to quickly check that all of the added documents are present in your database, along with their ID values, feel free to open the countries.json file and take a look. There should be six documents stored in it. Note: In this tutorial, the documents in your database are permanently stored in a JSON file, while the database itself exists only in memory. It’s also possible to create and work with documents entirely in-memory instead. To do this, you again import TinyDB , but also add from tinydb.storages import MemoryStorage . This allows you to create an in-memory database using something like countries_db = TinyDB(storage=MemoryStorage) . Notice that you don’t specify a file, since nothing is saved to disk. Now that you know how to create databases and add documents, it’s time to move on to the R in CRUD and learn how to read documents from your database. Remove ads Read Documents From Your Database Once your documents are safely stored in the database, you’ll likely want to read some or all of them. To do this, you construct a query. As you’ll see in this section, you can query your database in several different ways. You’ll use the ten_countries.json file available in your downloadables. It contains population details for the ten countries with the largest populations at the time of writing. Each document includes five of the fields explained in the table at the start of this tutorial. If you’d like to open the file in your favorite JSON or text editor, you’ll see its content. To search for specific documents in your database, you need both a Query instance to define the information you need and a reference to the Table instance to search. To allow you to write various ad hoc queries, you decide to use the Python REPL as follows: Python >>> from pprint import pprint >>> from tinydb import Query , TinyDB >>> countries_db = TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) >>> countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) Your first step is to set up a database with the existing documents from ten_countries.json . You import TinyDB , but this time also the Query class. You’ll use this to define what you’re looking for. You also import pprint to format query results. You then create a database that contains the existing documents. To do this, you use the same syntax you used previously when you created a new database, but this time you reference an existing file. This opens the database and populates it with existing data. This time, because you’ve opened the database outside of a context manager, you’ll need to remember to close it manually after you’ve finished with it. You again create a reference to an existing table using the same approach as before. In this example, you use countries_db.table() and specify the existing countries table name. Next, you write a query to view some documents. Suppose you wanted to see the details of those documents with population field values between 220 million and 250 million: Python >>> query = Query () >>> query_def = ( query . population > 220_000_000 ) & ( ... query . population < 250_000_000 ... ) You call the Query() constructor and assign the new object to the query variable. Then, you use it to construct a query definition that specifies the information you want to extract from your database. The object that query references contains a set of instance attributes that mirror the fields in the table you’re querying, or more precisely, match the keys of the dictionary it’ll query. Since you want to see documents with population values between 220 million and 250 million, you define the query as (query.population > 220_000_000) & (query.population < 250_000_000) . In this case, you’ve used the .population attribute to query against this field. To make sure both clauses are included, you use the bitwise & operator, as well as the > and < comparison operators. With the query defined, run it to see the documents. To do this, you pass your query definition, query_def , into the table’s .search() method. This will run your query. To display the results neatly, you use the pprint() function : Python >>> pprint ( countries_table . search ( query_def )) [{'% of world': 2.9, 'date': '1 Mar 2023', 'location': 'Pakistan', 'population': 241499431, 'source': '2023 Census result'}, {'% of world': 2.7, 'date': '1 Jul 2023', 'location': 'Nigeria', 'population': 223800000, 'source': 'Official projection'}] As you can see, two documents match your criteria and are neatly displayed. Note: In addition to the bitwise & operator used in the previous example, you can also use Python’s other bitwise operators such as OR ( | ) and NOT ( ~ ) in your queries. So, had you used countries_table.search(~query_def) in your previous example, you’d have seen the other eight documents that don’t match your original query. You can use Python’s comparison operators as well. Now, suppose you want to see documents whose share of the global population is at least 17%. You might try to construct another query definition based on the % of world field. However, % of world can’t form an instance attribute of your query because it’s an invalid variable name. This would only produce a syntax error instead of the results you want. Fortunately, there’s another way. You can use dictionary notation to reference a field instead: Python >>> pprint ( countries_table . search ( query [ " % o f world" ] >= 17 )) [{'% of world': 17.3, 'date': '1 Jul 2025', 'location': 'India', 'population': 1417492000, 'source': 'Official projection'}, {'% of world': 17.2, 'date': '31 Dec 2024', 'location': 'China', 'population': 1408280000, 'source': 'Official estimate'}] This time, you use Python dictionary notation ( [] ) to reference a field in your query. The pprint() function prints the search results on screen. Note: If you’re familiar with SQL, then you’ll know that its WHERE clause is used to filter values that meet certain criteria. Later, you’ll see how a where() function can be used to mimic SQL behavior. For example, the previous query could have been written as countries_table.search(where('% of world') >= 17) . You’ve already seen that each document in a TinyDB database gets assigned a unique identifier within its table. The first document added is assigned ID 1 , the second 2 , and so on. To read a document from a table by its identifier value, you can use the table’s .get() method. Here, you decide to look at the documents whose IDs are 9 and 10 , so you pass these values as a Python list to .get() using its doc_ids parameter. Had you wanted to see a single document, you’d have passed its ID using the singularly named doc_id parameter: Python >>> pprint ( countries_table . get ( doc_ids = [ 9 , 10 ])) [{'% of world': 1.8, 'date': '1 Jan 2025', 'location': 'Russia', 'population': 146028325, 'source': '???'}, {'% of world': 1.6, 'date': '30 Jun 2025', 'location': 'Mexico', 'population': 0, 'source': '???'}] As you can see, two documents have been returned. If you look carefully, you’ll notice something wrong with the source fields in each, and Mexico appears to be devoid of people. Don’t worry, you’ll fix these in the next section. You’ve finished with this database, so to ensure all documents are safely saved, you must close it. You need to close the database manually because you didn’t use a context manager when you opened it: Python >>> countries_db . close () Now that you know how to find documents, next you’ll learn about the U in CRUD. It’s time to learn how to update documents. Remove ads Update Documents in Your Database Sometimes, the documents in your database become outdated or contain errors. To fix this, you need to update them. In this section, you’ll use the .update() and .update_multiple() methods on your Table to make changes to some existing documents. As you’ve seen, it seems no one lives in Mexico, and the source of this information is unclear. After conducting some research, you find that the most recent national quarterly estimate reports that Mexico has a population of 130,575,786. You decide to update your database to reflect this corrected information. Because you have multiple changes to make, you again decide to create a script. As before, you create the references to the existing database table: Python update_db.py 1 from tinydb import TinyDB , where 2 3 with TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) as countries_db : 4 countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) To begin, you import the libraries you’ll need, this time including the where() function. You’ll use where() to find the documents you want to update and, again, to verify that your updates have worked. Because you choose to use where() , there’s no need to import Query . As before, you open the ten_countries.json file as a TinyDB instance and set the countries_table variable to reference the countries table. Now that you can access the database, you can update it: Python update_db.py 6 countries_table . update ( 7 { "population" : 130_575_786 }, where ( "location" ) == "Mexico" 8 ) 9 10 countries_table . update ( 11 { "source" : "National quarterly update" }, 12 where ( "location" ) == "Mexico" , 13 ) To update the Mexico document, you pass two arguments to the .update() method of countries_table . First, you pass a dictionary representing the part of the document you want to update, and second, you pass where("location") == "Mexico" to reference the document to update. You then use the same technique to update the source field of the same document. To apply the updates, run the script: Shell (venv) $ python update_db.py Finally, to make sure the updates have worked as you expect, you run a quick query in the REPL : Python >>> from pprint import pprint >>> from tinydb import TinyDB , where >>> with TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) as countries_db : ... countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) ... pprint ( countries_table . search ( where ( "location" ) == "Mexico" )) [{'% of world': 1.6, 'date': '30 Jun 2025', 'location': 'Mexico', 'population': 130575786, 'source': 'National quarterly update'}] As you can see, the updates were successful! Earlier, you saw how .insert_multiple() allows you to perform multiple inserts. You can update multiple documents at the same time with .update_multiple() . The previous code could also have been written like this: Python update_db_v2.py from tinydb import TinyDB , where with TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) as countries_db : countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) countries_table . update_multiple ( [ ( { "population" : 130_575_786 }, where ( "location" ) == "Mexico" , ), ( { "source" : "National quarterly update" }, where ( "location" ) == "Mexico" , ), ] ) This time, instead of passing in the dictionary and document information into .update() twice, you pass them in as a list of Python tuples to .update_multiple() . This code applies the same updates as before. In the previous example, only the Mexico document was updated. This is because there was only one document with that location value. Had there been more, you’d have updated them as well. Suppose you now want to update a single document, but one that can’t be uniquely identified by a field. The solution is to update specific documents based on their document ID values. If you look at the ten_countries.json file, you’ll see that the source fields of documents 7 and 9 contain no meaningful information. Perhaps you want to update those fields to show that the populations are official estimates. The code below shows you how: Python update_db_v3.py from tinydb import TinyDB with TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) as countries_db : countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) countries_table . update ({ "source" : "Official estimate" }, doc_ids = [ 7 , 9 ]) To update documents by their unique document IDs, you again use .update() . As before, you pass in the update as a dictionary, but instead of identifying the document to be updated by a potentially duplicate field value, you use the doc_ids parameter and assign it a list of the document IDs you want to update. As with the .get() method you used earlier, you can also use doc_id with .update() to update a single document. This is useful when documents can’t be uniquely identified by a field name. Go ahead and run this code, then use the techniques you learned earlier to verify that the updates work as expected. Note: You can also use upserting , which combines updating and inserting into a single operation. This allows you to insert a new document into your database. If that document already exists, the updates will be applied to it. For example, table.upsert(dictionary, where("location") == "Japan") will take the contents of dictionary and either add its updates to an existing document whose location is Japan , or create a completely new document if one doesn’t already exist. Finally, you’ll move on to the D in CRUD. It’s time to learn how to clear out unwanted crud by deleting documents and tables from your database. Remove ads Delete Documents From Your Database There may be times when you no longer need some documents in your database. To keep file size small and search performance efficient, it’s a good idea to delete any obsolete documents. In this section, you’ll learn how to remove unwanted documents using the .remove() and .truncate() table methods. You’ll also learn how to remove entire tables using the database’s .drop_table() and .drop_tables() methods. Suppose you decide that you no longer need the documents with ID values of 3 , 5 , and 7 stored in ten_countries.json . To begin with, your database still contains all ten documents. You can verify this by passing a table reference to the Python len() function: Python >>> from tinydb import TinyDB , where >>> countries_db = TinyDB ( "ten_countries.json" ) >>> countries_table = countries_db . table ( name = "countries" ) >>> len ( countries_table ) 10 Since len(countries_table) returns 10 , you’ve confirmed that ten documents are indeed present. To remove documents, use the .remove() method of countries_table . You do this by passing a Python list of document IDs you want to remove to its doc_ids parameter: Python >>> countries_table . remove ( doc_ids = [ 3 , 5 , 7 ]) [3, 5, 7] >>> len ( countries_table ) 7 You can see from the returned list [3, 5, 7] that these three documents have been removed, leaving seven remaining. Your second call to len() again confirms this. Sometimes, you might want to remove a group of documents from your database based on their data. For example, suppose you want to remove documents with a population of fewer than 300 million. To do this, you once more use the .remove() method: Python >>> countries_table . remove ( where ( "population" ) < 300_000_000 ) [4, 6, 8, 9, 10] >>> len ( countries_table ) 2 To specify the documents to be removed, you decide to use the where() function to identify documents whose population field value meets a condition. You pass where("population") < 300_000_000 into the .remove() method of countries_table to remove them. Now only two documents remain. Feel free to write a query to find out what they are, or take a look directly at the now poorly named ten_countries.json file to see what’s left. Suppose you want to remove all documents from the countries table. You could do this by editing the ten_countries.json file directly, but it’s probably cleaner to do it using code: Python >>> countries_table . truncate () >>> len ( countries_table ) 0 To remove all documents from a table in your database, you call .truncate() on countries_table . This will remove all documents, but not the table itself. This means you can add more documents to it if you want. As you can see, the len() function tells you there are no documents left. Feel free to look inside your ten_countries.json file, and you’ll see what an empty table looks like. To delete the table, whether it’s empty or not, you can use the .drop_table() method on your countries_db database and pass in the table name: Python >>> countries_db . tables () {'countries'} >>> countries_db . drop_table ( name = "countries" ) >>> countries_db . tables () Before you drop a table, you decide to check to make sure you know its correct name. To do this, you call the .tables() method on your database. This returns a Python set containing the tables. In this case, there’s only one named countries . To remove this table, you call .drop_table() on your database and pass it name="countries" . Finally, you check to see the updated list of tables. This time, an empty set object was returned, indicating the database is now empty. If you check the JSON file, and yes, it still exists, you’ll see a somewhat boring empty pair of curly braces. You can now delete it if you wish. Note: If you need to drop several tables, you can do so by making multiple calls to .drop_table() . To drop all tables from your database at once, use .drop_tables() . Although TinyDB is an extremely useful tool, it’s important to be aware of its limitations to round off your learning experience. Remove ads Understand Limitations and Gotchas Although TinyDB is lightweight and straightforward to use, its simplicity does come at a cost: Non-relational: It doesn’t provide full relational functionality or referential integrity, so if you want to link documents across multiple tables, you’ll need to write Python code to do so. Querying: TinyDB lacks projection capabilities. You’ve already seen a few of the techniques available to return entire documents. However, if you want to return partial documents—such as a list of values from a specific field—you need to write Python code to do this manually. Transactions: TinyDB doesn’t provide ACID guarantees because it’s not designed for use in distributed or multi-user environments. For example, it doesn’t support multithreading or concurrency , so it’s not suitable for multi-user web applications. Storage: Its default storage is JSON, so only JSON-serializable data types are supported. However, programmers can write extensions to support other storage formats such as YAML . Also, make sure that the field names you use follow Python variable naming conventions to avoid limiting the options available to you when querying. Conclusion TinyDB provides a NoSQL, document-oriented database that supports the four CRUD operations found in larger database systems, but without their complex setup or configuration requirements. It’s written entirely in Python and requires no additional dependencies, which makes it easy to embed directly into your Python projects. With TinyDB, you can quickly persist documents in JSON format, query them, and update them through a clean, Pythonic API. In this tutorial, you’ve learned how to: Create a database and tables for storing documents, and add documents to your database Write queries to view documents based on different criteria using multiple techniques Update single and multiple documents in your database Delete documents and tables from your database Understand the advantages and limitations of TinyDB If TinyDB has grabbed your attention, then its official documentation will show you even more of its capabilities.

Frequently Asked Questions Now that you’ve gained some experience with TinyDB in Python, you can use the questions and answers below to check your understanding and recap what you’ve learned. These FAQs are related to the most important concepts you’ve covered in this tutorial. Click the Show/Hide toggle beside each question to reveal the answer. What types of projects is TinyDB best suited for? Show/Hide TinyDB works best for local, small-scale, single-process applications such as scripts, CLI tools, and prototypes that need simple data persistence without the overhead of setting up a full database server. How does TinyDB store its data? Show/Hide By default, TinyDB stores documents as dictionaries in a JSON file on disk. Each document is automatically assigned a unique document ID within its table. Do all documents in a TinyDB table need to have the same fields? Show/Hide No. TinyDB is schema-less, so documents in the same table can have different fields. Each document is simply a Python dictionary with its own set of key-value pairs. What is the difference between .insert() and .insert_multiple() in TinyDB? Show/Hide The .insert() method adds a single document to a table, while .insert_multiple() accepts a list of documents and inserts them all at once. Why should you use a context manager when working with TinyDB? Show/Hide Using a context manager ensures that the database is automatically closed when you’re done, which helps guarantee that all documents are safely saved. Without a context manager, you must call .close() manually to avoid potential data loss.

Note that the 3.x.z part is a placeholder here. In your machine, x and z will be numbers corresponding to the specific version you have installed. Alternatively, you can use the -V switch: Windows PowerShell PS> python -V Python 3.x.z You can also use the py launcher, which is the Python launcher for Windows and is especially helpful if you plan to work with multiple Python versions: Windows PowerShell PS> py - -version Python 3.x.z Using the python --version , python -V , or py --version command, you can check whether Python is installed on your system and learn what version you have. If Python isn’t installed on your OS, you’ll get an error message. Knowing the Python Installation Options on Windows Python 3.14 introduced the Python Install Manager, which is a modern installation system that handles version management and automatic updates. This new tool is available through the Microsoft Store and Python.org. It’ll replace the traditional installer that’s been deprecated and won’t be produced for Python 3.16 or later . You’ll have different options to install Python on a Windows machine: The Microsoft Store : The recommended installation method for Python 3.14+. It delivers the Python Install Manager with automatic updates and integrated version management. The traditional Python installer for Windows : The traditional installer from Python.org. While still functional, this method is considered legacy and has been deprecated in favor of the Python Install Manager. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) : Run Python in a Linux environment directly on Windows. In this section, you’ll focus on only the first two options, which are the most popular ones on Windows environments. Note: You can also complete the installation on Windows using alternative distributions, such as Anaconda , but this tutorial covers only official distributions. Anaconda is a popular platform for scientific computing and data science with Python. To learn how to install Anaconda on Windows, check out the Setting Up Python for Machine Learning on Windows tutorial. If you want to install Python in the WSL, you can read the Linux-related sections of this tutorial after installing the Linux distribution of your choice. Remove ads Windows: How to Install Python From the Microsoft Store If you’re looking for the quickest and most modern installation approach, then you can install Python from the Microsoft Store. For Python 3.14+, the Microsoft Store delivers the Python Install Manager, which provides automatic updates and integrated version management. This Python package from the Microsoft Store is identical to the traditional version from Python.org, with the same features and capabilities. According to the official Python documentation , both versions provide a full Python installation suitable for development and production use. Note: If you’re installing Python 3.13 or earlier from the Microsoft Store, be aware that those versions have some limitations with write access to shared system locations. These limitations were addressed in Python 3.14’s Python Install Manager. The main advantage of the Microsoft Store version is convenience because it integrates with Windows’ app management system and handles updates automatically. Step 1: Open the Python App Page on the Microsoft Store Open the Microsoft Store application on your Windows machine and search for the Python Install Manager app. Select the app to navigate to its page. Note: Make sure that the application you’ve selected is by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) , which is the organization behind Python’s development. The official Python Install Manager app on the Microsoft Store is free, so if the app costs you money, then it’s the wrong application. Once you’re there, you’re ready to start with the installation process. Step 2: Install the Python Install Manager App After you’ve selected the Python Install Manager app, follow these steps to complete the installation: Click the Get button. Wait for the app to download. Click the Open button. When you click the Open button, you’ll be presented with a terminal window. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. Once the installation is complete, open Windows PowerShell and run the python --version command to confirm that Python is installed on your machine. Note that the installation will reside in your user folder, so you don’t need admin privileges to complete the process. Along with the Python interpreter , you can access a few other tools, including the py launcher, pip , and IDLE ! Windows: How to Install Python Using the Traditional Installer The traditional installer from Python.org has been the standard installation method for many years. According to the official Python documentation, this installer is: […] deprecated since 3.14 and will not be produced for Python 3.16 or later ( Source ) With the Python Install Manager recommended as the modern replacement. However, understanding this installation process is still valuable, especially if you’re working with existing Python installations or earlier versions. In this section, you’ll go through the necessary steps to install Python using the traditional installer from Python.org. Remove ads Step 1: Download the Traditional Python Installer Follow the steps below to download the traditional Python installer from the Python.org site: Open your browser and navigate to the downloads page for Windows on Python.org. Under the Python Releases for Windows heading, click the link for the Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.z . Scroll to the bottom and select Windows installer (64-bit) , Windows installer (32-bit) , or Windows installer (ARM64) according to your system architecture. Note: If you visit Python.org and hover your mouse over the Downloads menu, a box will appear showing the latest release of Python available for your current computer. This provides a quick way to download the appropriate installer without navigating through multiple pages. When you finish downloading the installer, then you can move on to the next step. Step 2: Run the Python Installer Once you’ve chosen and downloaded an installer, run it by double-clicking on the file. An installation wizard like the one below will appear on your screen: There are a couple of things to notice about the wizard’s initial window: The default install path is in the C:\Program Files\Python314\ directory, which will require admin privileges. The Customize installation button allows you to tweak some additional features, including installing the Python documentation, pip , IDLE , the test suite, and the py launcher. It also allows you to decide whether you want to install Python for all users, which requires admin privileges. You can also customize some advanced options, including file association, shortcuts creation, adding Python to the system environment variables, and even using a custom install location if you don’t have admin privileges. As you can conclude, the Python installer gives you granular control over the installation process on Windows. Note: If you want the python command to work on your Windows machine, then make sure that the Add Python to environment variables check box is activated, which is the default. Use the options in the dialog box to customize the installation to meet your needs. Then click Install . That’s it! You now have the latest version of Python on your Windows machine! If you’re curious to know where the installation is located, then use the where.exe command in PowerShell: Windows PowerShell PS> where . exe python C:\Program Files\Python314\python.exe Note that the where.exe command will work only if Python has been installed for your user account. macOS: How to Check or Get Python Python comes preinstalled on macOS. However, the installed version may not be the most recent one. To take advantage of Python’s latest features, you’ll need to download and install newer versions alongside the system one. Note that Python 3.14 requires macOS 10.15 Catalina or later to work properly. Checking the Python Version on macOS To check which Python version you have on your Mac, open a command-line application like Terminal. Here’s how you open Terminal on macOS: Press the Cmd + Space keys. Type Terminal . Press Enter . Alternatively, you can open Finder and navigate to Go → Utilities → Terminal . With the command line open, type in the following commands: Shell $ python3 --version This command will respond with a version number. Alternatively, you can use the shorter -V switch, which has the same effect. In practice, you’d want to get the latest version of Python if none of the above commands returns a version number or if you have a version of Python 3 that isn’t the latest available. Now, you can read through the following sections to learn about the different options for installing Python on macOS. Remove ads Knowing the Python Installation Options on macOS You’ll have two main options to install Python on macOS: The official Python installer for macOS : This option involves downloading the official installer from the Python.org website and running it on your machine. The Homebrew package manager : This option involves downloading and installing the Homebrew package manager if you don’t already have it and then running the required installation command in your terminal application. The official Python installer and the Homebrew Python distribution will work, but the Python Software Foundation maintains only the official installer. Note: You can also complete the installation on macOS using alternative Python distributions, such as Anaconda , but this tutorial covers only official distributions. Anaconda is a popular platform for scientific computing and data science using Python. To learn how to install Anaconda on macOS, check out the macOS installation guide from the official Anaconda documentation. Now that you know your options for installing Python on macOS, it’s time to get your hands dirty and go through the installation process. macOS: How to Install Python Using the Official Installer The recommended and most reliable option for installing Python in macOS is to use the official installer from Python.org. This installer includes all the system dependencies you’d need to develop full-fledged applications with Python. Step 1: Download the Python Official Installer You can install Python in two steps using the official installer: Open a browser window and navigate to the downloads page for macOS . Under the Python Releases for macOS heading, click the link for the Latest Python 3 Release - Python 3.x.z . Scroll to the Files section and click Download macOS Installer to start the download. When the download is finished, move on to the next step. Step 2: Run the Python Installer Run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file or by clicking the file in the Dock’s Downloads icon. You’ll see a window like the following: Follow these on-screen steps to complete the installation: Press Continue a couple of times until you’re asked to agree to the software license agreement. Then click Agree . Press Customize in the Installation Type window if you want to customize the installation. When the installer is finished, a Finder window will be opened and you’ll see the installation artifacts there. You now have the latest version of Python on your macOS computer, and you’re ready to start coding cool apps! macOS: How to Install Python From Homebrew The Homebrew package manager is another good option for installing Python on macOS. You can install Python using the Homebrew package manager in two steps, but first, you need to be aware of some limitations of the Python package on Homebrew. The Python distribution available on Homebrew doesn’t include the Tcl/Tk dependency , which is required by the Tkinter module . Tkinter is the standard library module for developing graphical user interfaces in Python and is an interface for the Tk GUI toolkit , which isn’t part of Python. Homebrew doesn’t install the Tk GUI toolkit dependency. Instead, it relies on an existing version installed on your system. The system version of Tcl/Tk may be outdated or missing entirely and could prevent you from using Tkinter. Note: If you need Tkinter support with Homebrew Python, you can install it separately: Shell $ brew install python-tk@3.14 Finally, note that the Python distribution on Homebrew isn’t maintained by the Python Software Foundation and could change at any time. Remove ads Step 1: Install the Homebrew Package Manager If you already have Homebrew installed on your macOS system, then you can skip this step. If you don’t have it installed, then use the following procedure: Open a browser and navigate to brew.sh . Copy the installation command under the Install Homebrew heading. Open a terminal window and paste the command, then press Enter . Enter your macOS user password when prompted. Depending on your internet connection speed, the process may take a few minutes to download all of Homebrew’s required files. Once the installation is complete, you’ll be back at the shell prompt in your terminal window. Note: If you’re doing this on a fresh install of macOS, you may get a pop-up alert asking you to install Apple’s command line developer tools. These tools are necessary for installation, so you can confirm the dialog box by clicking Install . After the developer tools are installed, you’ll need to press Enter to continue installing Homebrew. Now that Homebrew is installed, you’re ready to install Python. Step 2: Install Python With Homebrew Installing Python with the Homebrew package manager is now as straightforward as running the following command: Shell $ brew install python This command will download, install, and set up the latest version of Python on your machine. You can make sure everything went correctly by testing if you can access Python from the terminal. If you get an error message, then go through the install steps again to make sure you have a working installation. Linux: How to Check or Get Python In this section, you’ll learn how to check which version of Python, if any, is on your Linux computer. You’ll also learn about the installation options to get the latest Python on Linux systems. Checking the Python Version on Linux Most Linux distributions come with Python installed by default. In most cases, the installed version won’t be the latest Python. To find out which version of Python you have on Linux, open a terminal window and run the following command: Shell $ python3 --version If you have Python on your machine, then this command will respond with a version number. Instead of --version , you can use the shorter -V switch: Shell $ python3 -V Either of these switches will give you the version number of the Python installation that the command is associated with. If your current version is outdated, you’ll want to get the latest version of Python. Knowing the Python Installation Options on Linux There are two main ways to install the official Python distribution on a Linux operating system: Install from a package manager: This is the most common installation option on most Linux distributions. It involves running a command from the command line. Build from source code: This option can be difficult because it involves running a series of commands from the command line as well as making sure you have the correct dependencies installed to build Python from its source code. Not every Linux distribution has Python in their package repository. So, depending on your distribution, building Python from source code might be your only option. Note: Because of the wide variety of Linux distributions out there, you won’t find an official installer that you can execute on your Linux system to install Python like you can on macOS and Windows. If your Linux distribution includes Python in its list of available packages, you may realize that the version in the repository isn’t the latest version available on Python.org. In this situation, your only option to have the latest version is to build it from the source. If you have a rolling release Linux distribution like Arch , Manjaro , openSUSE Tumbleweed , and others, then you’ll probably have the latest version of Python available for installation or update using the system’s package manager. In this situation, to update your Python, you’d only have to update the system with the appropriate commands. Note: You can also complete the Python installation on Linux using alternative distributions or tools, such as Anaconda and pyenv . The installation option boils down to whether your Linux has Python available in its software repository and whether you need to control the details of the installation. Remove ads Linux: How to Build Python From Source Code You’ll have at least three reasons to choose to build Python from source code: You need to install the latest version of Python or a version unavailable on your distribution’s repository. You need to control how Python is compiled, such as when you want to lower the memory footprint on embedded systems. You want to try out pre-release versions to explore new features. You can run the steps in the following sections to complete the installation on your Linux machine. Step 1: Download the Python Source Code To start, you need to clone the CPython repository from GitHub or get the Python source code from Python.org. If you go to the downloads page, then you’ll find the latest source for Python 3 at the top. When you select the latest Python version, you’ll see a Files section at the bottom of the page. Select Gzipped source tarball and download it to your machine. If you prefer to use your command line, then you can use wget to download the file to your current directory: Shell $ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.x.z/Python-3.x.z.tgz For this command to work, you must specify the version to download. When the tarball finishes downloading, there are a few things you’ll need to do to prepare your system for building Python. Step 2: Prepare Your System for Building Python There are a few distro-specific steps involved in building Python from source. The goal of this section is to prepare your system for building Python. Below, you’ll find specific steps for some popular Linux distributions. Ubuntu, Debian, and Linux Mint First, update the list of available packages and upgrade them using the following commands: Shell $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt upgrade Note that because you’re using the sudo command, you’ll be prompted to provide your root password. Next, make sure you have all of the build requirements installed: Shell $ sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \ libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \ libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev It’s okay if you already have some of these requirements installed on your system. You can execute the above commands, and any existing packages will be skipped. openSUSE Linux Building from source is the most reliable way to install Python on openSUSE . To do that, you’ll need to install the development tools, which can be done in YaST via the menus or by using the zypper command as shown below: Shell $ sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_C_C This might take a while to complete as it installs several packages. So, feel free to grab a coffee and relax. Fedora Linux To prepare your Fedora system for building Python from sources, you should first update the system with the dnf package manager : Shell $ sudo dnf -y update Once dnf finishes updating, you can install the necessary build dependencies with the following commands: Shell $ sudo dnf -y groupinstall "Development Tools" $ sudo dnf -y install gcc openssl-devel bzip2-devel libffi-devel These commands will download and install all the required tools for compiling Python from its source code. Remove ads Step 3: Build and Install Python on Your System Once you have your system ready and the TAR file with the Python source code, you can unpack the source into a directory: Shell $ tar xvf Python-3.x.z.tgz $ cd Python-3.x.z/ This command unpacks the source code into a directory named after the TAR file. Note that the TAR file will show a specific Python version rather than 3.x.z in your output. Now you need to run the ./configure script to prepare the build: Shell $ ./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip = install The --enable-optimizations flag will enable some optimizations within Python to make it run faster. Doing this may add twenty or thirty minutes to the compilation time. The --with-ensurepip=install flag will install pip bundled with this installation. Next, you build Python using the make command. The -j option allows you to tell make to split the building into parallel steps to speed up the compilation. Even with the parallel builds, this step can take several minutes: Shell $ make -j 8 Finally, you have to install your compiled version of Python. You’ll use the altinstall target here to avoid overwriting the system Python. You’ll need to run the following command as root: Shell $ sudo make altinstall The installation might take a while to finish. Once done, you can verify that Python is set up correctly. Step 4: Verify Your Python Installation Test that the command below returns the compiled version of Python: Shell $ python3.x --version Python 3.x.z Again, in your case, this command would need to be run using the specific version number. You can also run the Python test suite to ensure everything works properly on your system. To do this, execute the following command: Shell $ python3.x -m test You’ll probably want to find something else to do for a while, as your computer will be running tests for some time. If all the tests pass, then you can be confident that your brand-new Python build will work as expected! iOS: How to Install Python The Pythonista app for iOS is a full-fledged Python development environment that you can run on your iPhone or iPad. It features a Python editor, technical documentation, and an interpreter, all rolled into a single app. Pythonista is surprisingly fun to use. It’s a great little tool when you’re stuck without a laptop and want to work on your Python skills on the go. It comes with the complete Python standard library and includes full documentation you can browse offline. To set up Pythonista, you need to download it from the iOS app store .

My displays keep rearranging and displayplacer fixed it - Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog About Archive RSS Today I Learned My displays keep rearranging and displayplacer fixed it Today I learned about displayplacer - “macOS command line utility to configure multi-display resolutions and arrangements.” In December, I upgraded to MacOS Tahoe and picked up the TS4 dock for my work machine. While my upgrade was painless, the biggest issue I’ve had is with my displays. Every time my displays go to sleep and then I come back from lunch or come back the next day to work, my orientation of my displays changes and it puts them in a random order. My displays should be arranged like this: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] But after waking from sleep, they end up like this: [ 2 ] [ 1 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] It’s really annoying. It takes a minute to fix and it’s just frustrating. I tried displayplacer today. I had Claude Code actually run the displayplacer list command. It figured out which displays and which settings needed to be changed. I had it record that and then I tried it out a few times where I manually dragged my displays around, put them in the wrong order, then ran the command, and it just magically worked. I saved the working configuration to a shell script: #!/usr/bin/env bash # Restore display layout: 4 monitors (2x 16" 1920x1080, 2x 73" 2048x1280) displayplacer \ "id:F4AB0D6C-8E85-4E84-B5AB-C5B388536E3D res:1920x1080 hz:60 color_depth:8 enabled:true scaling:off origin:(0,0) degree:0" \ "id:C9240C8E-A9D2-418A-89AC-28D3B5DEE5FC res:1920x1080 hz:60 color_depth:8 enabled:true scaling:off origin:(-1920,0) degree:0" \ "id:B43E3352-ACB7-4163-A25B-2DDAE0174571 res:2048x1280 hz:60 color_depth:8 enabled:true scaling:off origin:(0,-1280) degree:0" \ "id:B32F530C-62CF-4F0D-9997-80BF2B812AC8 res:2048x1280 hz:60 color_depth:8 enabled:true scaling:off origin:(-2048,-1280) degree:0" I also tried setting it up as a Stream Deck key and for some reason I couldn’t get that to work. But it’s fine. I can run a shell script and that takes a lot less time to get it in the right order. Wednesday February 18, 2026 🐘 Reply on Mastodon © 2026, Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog

Jordan Baird's Ice beta fixed my macOS Tahoe menu bar issues - Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog About Archive RSS Today I Learned Jordan Baird's Ice beta fixed my macOS Tahoe menu bar issues If you use a Mac, you’ve probably noticed that the menu bar fills up with icons pretty quickly. Bartender and Ice (sadly, now an unfortunate name) are apps that let you manage and hide unwanted icons from your macOS menu bar so it stays clean and uncluttered. About a year ago, I switched from Bartender to Ice, which just happens to be open source, because there was some drama . Since then, I’ve been very happy with Ice. A couple of months ago, I upgraded to macOS Tahoe, and my menu bar stopped working correctly. The icon colors were all this weird shade of blue, so I couldn’t customize anything. After months of trying to figure it out, I noticed that it had been a while since Ice released a new version. That’s how open source goes sometimes. I was getting to the point of deciding whether to go back to Bartender or stick with Ice. Today, I noticed that there’s a Homebrew package for jordanbaird-ice@beta . I decided to give it a try, removed the old version, installed the beta, and to my surprise and delight, the problem was fixed. # remove the stable version brew remove jordanbaird-ice # install the beta brew install jordanbaird-ice@beta I’m hoping there’s a more official release soon. The new Bartender looks good too, so if Ice doesn’t keep getting updated, I might switch back. If you’ve run into this same issue, give the beta a try and let me know how it goes. And if you know of any alternatives to Bartender and Ice, I’d love to hear about those too. Thursday February 19, 2026 © 2026, Jeff Triplett's Micro.blog

Today we're excited to share that we've completed the first step of that journey! What We've Done We've merged new documentation that outlines how any member of the Django community can propose changes to our Code of Conduct and related policies. This creates a transparent, community-driven process for keeping our policies current and relevant. The new process includes: Proposing Changes : Anyone can open an issue with a clear description of their proposed change and the rationale behind it. Community Review : The Code of Conduct Working Group will discuss proposals in our monthly meetings and may solicit broader community feedback through the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack. Approval and Announcement : Once consensus is reached, changes are merged and announced to the community. Changes to the Code of Conduct itself will be sent to the DSF Board for final approval. How You Can Get Involved We welcome and encourage participation from everyone in the Django community! Here's how you can engage with this process: Share Your Ideas : If you have suggestions for improving our Code of Conduct or related documentation, open an issue on our GitHub repo. Join the Discussion : Participate in community discussions about proposed changes on the forum, Discord, or DSF Slack. Keep it positive, constructive, and respectful. Stay Informed : Watch the Code of Conduct repository to follow along with proposed changes and discussions. Provide Feedback : Not comfortable with GitHub? You can also reach out via conduct@djangoproject.com , or look for anyone with the Code of Conduct WG role on Discord. What's Next We're moving forward with the remaining steps of our plan: Step 2 (target: March 15): Update our Enforcement Manual , Reporting Guidelines , and FAQs via pull request 91 . Step 3 (target: April 15): Adopt the Contributor Covenant 3 with proposed changes from the working group. Each step will have its own pull request where the community can review and provide feedback before we merge. We're committed to taking the time needed to incorporate your input thoughtfully.
